	(SD), 3) logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). PNFA is characterized
	by labored speech, agrammatism in production, and/or comprehension.
	In some cases the syndrome begins with isolated deficits in speech.
	SD patients typically present with loss of word and object meaning
	and surface dyslexia. LPA patients have word-finding difficulties,
	syntactically simple but accurate language output and impaired sentence
	comprehension. The neuropsychological data demonstrated that SD patients
	show the most characteristic pattern of impairment, while PNFA and
	LPA overlap within many cognitive domains. The neuroimaging analysis
	showed left perisylvian region involvement. A comprehensive cognitive,
	neuroimaging and pathological approach is necessary to identify the
	clinical and pathogenetic features of different PPA variants.},

	to localize brain damage in stroke patients. The same approach might
	be useful in the differential diagnosis of progressive aphasia owing
	to neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether scores
	on 4 widely used language tasks correlate with regional gray matter
	loss in 51 patients with progressive language impairment owing to
	neurodegenerative disease. METHOD: Scores in the Boston Naming Test
	and in the "repetition" "sequential commands" and the "language fluency,"
	subtests of the Western Aphasia Battery were correlated with voxel-wise
	gray matter volumes using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Significant
	positive correlations were found between each language task and regional
	brain volumes: (1) naming and the bilateral temporal lobes; (2) sentence
	repetition and the left posterior portion of the superior temporal
	gyrus; (3) sentence comprehension and the left dorsal middle and
	inferior frontal gyri; and (4) fluency of language production and
	the left ventral middle and inferior frontal gyri. DISCUSSION: Performance
	on specific language tasks corresponds to regional anatomic damage
	in aphasia owing to neurodegenerative disorders. These language tests
	might be useful in the differential diagnosis of primary progressive
	aphasia variants that have been previously associated with damage
	to corresponding anatomic regions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel fuzzy-segmentation method for diffusion
	tensor (DT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Typical fuzzy-segmentation
	schemes, e.g., those based on fuzzy C means (FCM), incorporate Gaussian
	class models that are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters
	characterized by a mean element and a covariance matrix. Tensors
	in fiber bundles, however, inherently lie on specific manifolds in
	Riemannian spaces. Unlike FCM-based schemes, the proposed method
	represents these manifolds using nonparametric data-driven statistical
	models. The paper describes a statistically-sound (consistent) technique
	for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian DT spaces. The proposed
	method produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel
	information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework.
	Results on synthetic and real, DT and MR images, show that the proposed
	method provides information about the uncertainties in the segmentation
	decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial
	voluming, and inhomogeneity. By enhancing the nonparametric model
	to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle,
	we exploit the framework to extract the cingulum fiber bundle. Typical
	tractography methods for tract delineation, incorporating thresholds
	on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking,
	can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise.
	For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts
	with sharp changes in orientation, such as the cingulum. The results
	demonstrate that the proposed method extracts this structure significantly
	more accurately as compared to tractography.},

	(average W-score=-1.3), severe in the frontal (W-score=-2.4) and
	very severe in the temporal lobes (W-score=-2.9). AD had moderate
	atrophy in the hippocampus and temporal lobes (W-score=-1.8 and -1.9,

	in FTD (n = 15; behavioural variant n = 9, language variant n = 6)
	in contrast with AD patients (n = 15) and age-matched controls (NC)
	(n = 15). FTD and AD patients were matched on demographic measures
	and Mini Mental State Examination scores. RESULTS: Significant atrophy
	was present in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of subjects
	with FTD compared to AD (p = 0.02; effect size = 1.11) and compared
	to NC (p < 0.001; effect size = 1.86). Severe atrophy of the left
	anterior temporal region distinguished the language variant. AD patients,
	by contrast, did not differ from NC for frontal lobe volume but had
	smaller anterior temporal lobes (p = 0.03). Both dementia groups
	had medial temporal lobe atrophy of similar magnitude. A logistic
	regression model including 4 regional measures correctly classified
	100\% of subjects. CONCLUSION: FTD can be reliably differentiated
	from AD by virtue of a topographical pattern of atrophy involving
	the frontal lobes and anterior temporal regions. Medial temporal

	an asymmetric left or right-sided anterior cerebral perfusion abnormality
	that is associated with differential behavioral symptoms. However,
	whether patients with primarily right versus left {F}{T}{D} also
	have unique neuropsychological characteristics has not been previously
	investigated. Comparisons of 11 patients with right-sided {F}{T}{D}
	and 11 with left {F}{T}{D} indicated that the 2 patient groups showed
	relatively distinct cognitive profiles. Patients with right {F}{T}{D}
	exhibited relatively worse performance on PIQ than VIQ, and on select
	nonverbal executive tasks relative to their verbal analogs (e.g.,
	design fluency < word generation; Picture Arrangement < word sequencing).
	In contrast, patients with left {F}{T}{D} showed the opposite pattern.
	In addition, the 2 patient groups differed on several absolute test
	scores; patients with right {F}{T}{D} demonstrated more errors and
	perseverative responses, and worse percent conceptual level responses,
	on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, while the left {F}{T}{D} patients
	obtained significantly worse scores on the Boston Naming Test, and
	Stroop word reading and color naming. Verbal and nonverbal memory,
	mental speed, visual perceptual-constructional skill, and IQ subtest
	scaled scores did not significantly differ between groups. These
	data indicate that {F}{T}{D} should not be viewed as a unitary disorder,
	and that neuropsychological testing holds promise for the differential
	diagnosis of right versus left {F}{T}{D}.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two major clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia
	(FTD) have been described: frontal variant (fvFTD) and temporal variant
	(tvFTD). OBJECTIVE: To analyze white matter (WM) and gray matter
	(GM) tissue organization in patients with fvFTD and tvFTD by means
	of diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry, and the
	correlations with neuropsychological and behavioral variables. DESIGN
	AND SETTING: Frontotemporal dementia clinic-based cohort and structural
	magnetic resonance imaging acquisition for voxel-based morphometry
	and diffusion tensor imaging measurements. Abnormalities were detected
	by a comparison with healthy control subjects. These variables were
	also correlated with clinical scores. Patients Thirty-six patients
	(28 with fvFTD and 8 with tvFTD) in early disease stage and 23 healthy
	controls who underwent standardized clinical and neuropsychological
	evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging. INTERVENTIONS: Diffusion
	tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
	Neuroimaging analyses resulted in localized GM atrophy and reductions
	of white matter densities; the latter correlated with behavioral
	scores. RESULTS: Voxel-based morphometry analysis showed separate
	patterns of GM atrophy in the 2 groups. Diffusion tensor imaging
	showed different WM reduction patterns in patients with fvFTD and
	tvFTD. The fvFTD group showed a selective WM reduction in the superior
	longitudinal fasciculus, interconnecting the frontal and occipital
	and the temporal and parietal regions. Conversely, patients with
	tvFTD were characterized by WM reductions in the inferior longitudinal
	fasciculus, which affected the connections between anterior temporal
	and frontal regions. The WM reductions in fvFTD paralleled both behavioral
	disturbances measured by Frontal Behavioral Inventory and neuropsychological
	deficits affecting frontal functions. CONCLUSIONS: The fvFTD and
	tvFTD variants are associated not only with selective local GM reductions
	but also with significant WM damage in early disease phase. The different
	WM patterns contribute to the different clinical syndromes in FTD
	and could be responsible for the further progression of atrophy in
	the later disease stages.},

	For each subject, we used two volumetric magnetic resonance (MR)

	of the same-day scans by a fixed amount, and rigidly registering

	based on results from single cases ([3]: Breedin SD, Saffran EM,

	in a case of progressive fluent aphasia. Cognitive Neuropsychology,
	(in-press).This study employed sound recognition and semantic association
	tasks to investigate the nature of the verbal and non-verbal comprehension
	deficit in 10 patients with semantic dementia. The patients were
	impaired on both verbal and non-verbal conditions of the assessments,
	and their accuracy on these tasks was directly related to their scores
	on a range of other tests requiring access to semantic memory. Further
	analyses revealed that performance was graded by concept and sound
	familiarity and, in addition, identified significant item consistency
	across the different conditions of the tasks. These results support
	the notion that the patients' deficits across all modalities were
	due to degradation within a single, central network of conceptual
	knowledge. There were also reliable differences between conditions.
	The sound-picture matching task proved to be more sensitive to semantic
	impairment than the word-picture matching equivalent, and the patients
	performed significantly better on the picture than word version of
	a semantic association test. We propose that these differences arise
	directly from the nature of the mapping between input modality and
	semantic memory. Words and sounds have an arbitrary relationship
	with meaning while pictures benefit from a degree of systematicity
	with conceptual knowledge about the object.},

	of hippocampal, entorhinal cortex (ERC), and whole brain longitudinal
	change in cognitively normal elderly controls (C), non-demented subjects
	with cognitive impairment (CI), and demented (D) subjects. METHODS:
	16 C, 6 CI, and 7 D subjects of comparable age were studied with
	{M}{R}{I} twice, at least 1 year apart. Longitudinal change in total
	brain size was measured by several methods, including computerized
	segmentation, non-linear warping, and change in the fluid/tissue
	boundaries between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain. Change in
	hippocampal volume was measured by semi-automated methods, and ERC
	volumes were manually measured. RESULTS: The annual rate of atrophy
	was greater in D versus C and D versus CI for cortical gray matter
	(cGM) (P=0.009 and 0.002), hippocampus (P=0.0001 and 0.002), and
	for the change in the fluid/tissue boundary (P=0.03 and 0.03). The
	annual rate of atrophy of ERC was greater in both CI and D versus
	C (P=0.01 and 0.0002). No significant differences between groups
	were found using non-linear warping. CONCLUSIONS: In CI, the greatest
	annual rates of atrophy were in ERC, while in D the greatest annual
	rates of atrophy were in hippocampus and cortex. Progressive ERC
	atrophy was observed with a greater degree of cognitive impairment,
	while hippocampal and cortical atrophy were only observed in demented

	dementia (FTLD) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). METHODS: Voxel-based
	morphometry was used to compare T1-weighted MRI images obtained from
	ten ALS patients with FTLD, ten ALS patients who were cognitively
	and behaviorally normal, and 22 control subjects. Images from patients
	and controls were spatially pre-processed using a study-specific,
	customized template and a priori images. A statistical threshold

	RESULTS: A common pattern of gray matter atrophy was seen in both
	ALS and ALS/FTLD patients when compared to controls that involved
	the bilateral motor/premotor cortices, the left middle and inferior
	frontal gyri, the anterior portion of the superior frontal gyri,
	the superior temporal gyri, the temporal poles and left posterior
	thalamus. Most of the frontal regions were significantly more atrophied

	to identify the patterns of WM atrophy in vivo in 2 clinical variants
	of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
	and semantic dementia-and to compare the patterns of WM atrophy with
	those of gray matter (GM) atrophy in these diseases. DESIGN: Structural
	MRIs were obtained from patients with FTD (n = 12) and semantic dementia
	(n = 13) and in cognitively healthy age-matched controls (n = 24).
	Regional GM and WM were classified automatically from high-resolution
	T1-, T2-, and proton density-weighted MRIs with Expectation-Maximization
	Segmentation and compared between the groups using a multivariate
	analysis of covariance model that included age and WM lesion volumes
	as covariates. RESULTS: Patients with FTD had frontal WM atrophy
	and frontal, parietal, and temporal GM atrophy compared with controls,
	who had none. Patients with semantic dementia had temporal WM and
	GM atrophy and patients with FTD had frontal GM atrophy. Adding temporal
	WM volume to temporal GM volume significantly improved the discrimination
	between semantic dementia and FTD. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
	that patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration who are in relatively
	early stages of the disease (Clinical Dementia Rating score, 1.0-1.2)
	have WM atrophy that largely parallels the pattern of GM atrophy
	typically associated with these disorders.},

  abstract = {Semantic dementia is a syndrome of progressive deterioration in semantic
	memory (knowledge of objects, people, concepts and words). It falls
	within the clinical spectrum of frontotemporal dementia but its pathology
	is yet to be studied systematically. This study included 18 consecutive
	post mortem cases meeting clinical criteria for semantic dementia.
	Clinic records and diagnostic histopathology were available for all
	cases; structural neuroimaging, neuropsychology and semi-quantitative
	histopathology/immunohistochemistry data were analysed where possible.
	The pathological diagnosis in a clear majority of cases was frontotemporal
	degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions (n = 13). Eleven of these
	cases had characteristic motor neuron disease-type inclusions in
	the dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex. Ubiquitin inclusions were
	found only in the inferior olivary nucleus in the other two, one
	of which was the only case to show degeneration of motor tracts and
	also to have shown evidence of motor neuron disease during life.
	None of the patients had motor symptoms or signs at presentation.
	A family history of motor neuron disease was documented in one case.
	Pick body-positive Pick's disease appeared three times. Two cases
	had Alzheimer's disease and significant coincidental Alzheimer-type
	pathology was also found in one of the ubiquitin inclusion cases.
	One of the Alzheimer's disease patients had changes in white matter
	signal on scanning, whereas all other scans showed cerebral atrophy
	only. Semi-quantitative assessment of regional neuronal loss found
	that anterior and inferior temporal regions bore the brunt of disease
	across all histopathological subtypes, usually on the left side,
	implicating this region in semantic processing.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be difficult
	to differentiate clinically because of overlapping symptoms. Distinguishing
	the two dementias based on volumetric measurements of brain atrophy
	with MRI has been only partially successful. Whether MRI measurements
	of cortical thinning improve the differentiation between Alzheimer's
	disease and FTD is unclear. In this study, we measured cortical thickness
	using a set of automated tools (Freesurfer) to reconstruct the brain's
	cortical surface from T1-weighted structural MRI data in 22 patients
	with Alzheimer's disease, 19 patients with FTD and 23 cognitively
	normal subjects. The goals were to detect the characteristic patterns
	of cortical thinning in these two types of dementia, to test the
	relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive impairment,
	to determine if measurement of cortical thickness is better than
	that of cortical volume for differentiating between these dementias
	and normal ageing and improving the classification of Alzheimer's
	disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores alone. Compared
	to cognitively normal subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients had
	a thinner cortex primarily in bilateral, frontal, parietal, temporal
	and occipital lobes (P < 0.001), while FTD patients had a thinner
	cortex in bilateral, frontal and temporal regions and some thinning
	in inferior parietal regions and the posterior cingulate (P < 0.001).
	Compared to FTD patients, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner
	cortex (P < 0.001) in parts of bilateral parietal and precuneus regions.
	Cognitive impairment was negatively correlated with cortical thickness
	of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer's disease, while
	similar correlations were not significant in FTD. Measurement of
	cortical thickness was similar to that of cortical volume in differentiating
	between normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and FTD. Furthermore,
	cortical thickness measurements significantly improved the classification
	between Alzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores
	alone, including the Mini-Mental State Examination and a modified
	version of the Trail-Making Test. In conclusion, the characteristic
	patterns of cortical thinning in Alzheimer's disease and FTD suggest
	that cortical thickness may be a useful surrogate marker for these
	types of dementia.},

	have not been studied quantitatively. OBJECTIVE: To compare volumetric
	measures among primary progressive aphasia (PPA), frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD) and AD; to assess association between brain atrophy
	and cognition. PATIENTS: Seventeen patients with PPA, 11 with FTD
	and 24 with probable AD were studied. METHODS: We measured total
	and regional volume quantitatively using MRI and computerized volumetry.
	Contributing factors were controlled statistically or by adopting
	brain volume ratios. We investigated the classifying power of volumetry
	and correlated regional brain volume with cognitive and language
	test scores. RESULTS: The ratio for fronto-temporo-central region
	was smaller on the left in PPA and on the right in FTD. AD and some
	PPA patients had smaller parietal lobes. The frontal ratios correctly
	classified 93\% of PPA and FTD patients, but only 50\% of the entire
	PiC and AD patients. Language-dependent examinations correlated with
	the left fronto-temporal volume. CONCLUSIONS: Brain atrophy differs
	in PPA, FTD and AD, but there is some morphological overlap between
	PiC and AD in parietal volumes. Focal brain atrophy is most consistently
	associated with language impairments.},

	hypothesis that distinct patterns of gray matter atrophy are responsible
	for unique interruptions of the naming process in {A}lzheimer's disease
	(AD) and frontotemporal dementia ({F}{T}{D}). MATERI{A}{L}{S} AND
	METHODS: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to characterize
	at the voxel level the neuroanatomic changes that occur in {A}{D}
	and {F}{T}{D} based on high-resolution T1-weighted three-dimensional
	(3D) spoiled-gradient echo images of patients (AD, n = 12; {F}{T}{D},
	n = 29) and healthy control subjects (n = 12). The cortical atrophy
	measurements were correlated with performance on behavioral measures
	of naming and related processes to identify brain regions that may
	contribute to this language function. RESULTS: Both {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D}
	have significant naming difficulty, and this difficulty in naming
	correlates with a measure of lexical retrieval in both patient groups
	as well. However, only {F}{T}{D} patients showed a correlation with
	semantic memory. Areas of cortical atrophy common to {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D}
	were found in the anterior temporal, posterolateral temporal, and
	dorsolateral prefrontal regions of the left hemisphere. Correlation
	with naming in both {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D} was seen in the left anterior
	temporal cortex, suggesting that this area may play a role in the
	lexical retrieval component of naming. We also observed several unique
	areas of cortical atrophy in temporal and frontal cortices of these
	patients. Right anterior temporal and left posterolateral temporal
	regions of atrophy correlated with naming difficulty in {F}{T}{D},
	suggesting that these areas may contribute to the semantic memory
	component of naming. Cortical areas correlating with naming that
	are not atrophic may represent regions that play an optional role
	in naming. CONCLUSION: VBM provides an important first step in analyzing
	brain-behavior relations in vivo in patients with neurodegenerative
	diseases. More refined analyses of brain morphology via high-dimensional
	normalization methods that are capable of modeling local as well
	as global variability in neuroanatomical structure promise to be
	even more informative.},

	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychological performance and high-resolution
	structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Distinguishing
	features of patients with tau-positive FTD include visual perceptual-spatial
	difficulty and an extrapyramidal disorder significantly more often
	than other patients, significant cortical atrophy in the frontal
	and parietal regions as evidenced on MRI, and the burden of pathology
	is greatest in the frontal and parietal regions. Patients with tau-negative
	FTD are distinguished by their greater difficulties with social,
	language, and verbally mediated executive functions, significant
	cortical atrophy in the frontal and temporal regions as evidenced
	on MRI, and significant frontal and temporal pathology. Patients
	with Alzheimer disease at autopsy have significantly impaired delayed
	recall during episodic memory testing; atrophy that involves temporal
	areas, including the hippocampus, as evidenced on MRI; and widely
	distributed pathology including the medial temporal structures. A
	discriminant function analysis grouped patients on the basis of clinical

	symptom, neuropsychological, and autopsy characteristics. RESULTS:
	There are notably different clinical and neuropsychological patterns
	of impairment in FTLD-U subtypes. Patients with FTLD-U/TDP-43 characterized
	by numerous neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions have shorter survival;
	patients with FTLD-U/TDP-43 featuring numerous neurites have difficulty
	with object naming; and patients with FTLD-U/TDP-43 in whom neuronal
	intranuclear inclusions are present have substantial executive deficits.
	There are also different anatomical distributions of ubiquitin pathologic

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the topography and degree of
	atrophy in speech and language-associated cortical gyri in Alzheimer's
	disease. The post-mortem brains of 10 patients with pathologically
	confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 21 neurological and neuropathological
	controls were sectioned in serial 3 mm coronal slices and grey and
	white matter volumes were determined for specific cortical gyri.
	All Alzheimer's disease patients had prospectively documented impairments
	in verbal and semantic memory with concomitant global decline. The
	cortical regions of interest included the planum temporale, Heschl's
	gyri, the anterior superior temporal gyri, the middle and inferior
	temporal gyri, area 37 at the inferior temporoparietal junction,
	areas 40 and 39 (supramarginal and angular gyri) and Broca's frontal
	regions. Although most patients had end-stage disease, the language-associated
	cortical regions were affected to different degrees, with some regions
	free of atrophy. These included Broca's regions in the frontal lobe
	and Heschl's gyri on the superior surface of the temporal lobe. In
	contrast, the inferior temporal and temporoparietal gyri (area 37)
	were severely reduced in volume. The phonological processing regions
	in the superior temporal gyri (the planum temporale) were also atrophic
	in all Alzheimer's disease patients while the anterior superior temporal
	gyri were only atrophic in female patients. Such atrophy may underlie
	the more severe language impairments previously described in females
	with Alzheimer's disease. The present study is the first to analyse
	the volumes of language-associated gyri in post-mortem patients with
	confirmed Alzheimer's disease. The results show that atrophy is not
	global but site-specific. Atrophied gyri appear to reflect a specific
	network of language and semantic memory dissolution seen in the clinical
	features of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Females showed greater
	atrophy than males in the anterior superior temporal gyri.},

	with different language deficits in cases of AD. METHODS: Cases for
	detailed neuropathologic analysis (Patients 1 and 2) were selected
	because of their detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments
	of language dysfunction in AD. Patient 1 had severe phonologic impairment
	with relatively preserved semantic aspects of language. Patient 2
	had severe semantic language impairment with relatively preserved
	phonologic skills. The tissue volume of cortical regions associated
	with speech and language function was measured using standardized
	three-dimensional techniques. Neuronal areal fraction was also measured
	from histologic tissue samples. The degree of volume atrophy and
	neuronal loss was calculated in comparison to control measures (n
	= 10 men and 11 women). Measurements more than 2 SD from controls
	were considered abnormal. RESULTS: Both AD cases had significant
	degeneration of the superior temporal gyrus and area 37. Cortical
	language regions affected only in Patient 1 included the anterior
	and posterior insula and part of Broca's area. In contrast, Patient
	2 had a greater degree of degeneration in the temporal gyri and their
	white matter connections with the hippocampal/entorhinal complex.
	CONCLUSIONS: Variable patterns of neurodegeneration underlie the
	clinical differences observed in patients with AD. Disconnection
	within the temporal lobe appears associated with semantic language
	difficulties, whereas disconnection of the anterior and posterior
	language areas appears associated with phonologic and grammatical

	and Cambridge (n = 30) over a 10-year period. Data were available
	on time of symptom onset, diagnosis, institutionalization, and death.
	Cases were classified pathologically as tau-positive and tau-negative.
	RESULTS: Of the 61 patients with {F}{T}{D}, 26 presented with frontal
	variant (fv{F}{T}{D}), 9 with semantic dementia, 8 with progressive
	nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), 9 with associated motor neuron disease
	({F}{T}{D}-MND), and 9 with corticobasal degeneration features. There
	was no difference between the groups in age at symptom onset (overall

	group was significantly older than the fv{F}{T}{D} (59.9 +/- 7.4)

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Until recently, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
	was considered a rare neurodegenerative disorder that was difficult
	to diagnose. The publication of consensus criteria for FTLD, however,
	prompted systematic studies. The criteria categorize FTLD into 3
	subgroups: frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and progressive
	nonfluent aphasia. OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic characteristics
	of patients in the 3 FTLD subgroups. DESIGN: We compared diagnostic
	breakdown, age at onset, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score
	at first visit, education, and neuropathological diagnoses in a large
	sample of FTLD patients from 3 different university dementia clinics,
	including 2 neurologic clinics in the United States and 1 psychiatric
	clinic in Germany. RESULTS: The frontotemporal dementia subgroup
	represented approximately half of all FTLD diagnoses. Patients diagnosed
	as having frontotemporal dementia (mean age, 57.5 years) and semantic
	dementia (mean age, 59.3 years) had an earlier age at onset than
	patients diagnosed as having progressive nonfluent aphasia (mean
	age, 63.0 years). There were significantly more men diagnosed as
	having frontotemporal dementia (63.5\%) and semantic dementia (66.7\%)
	when compared with progressive nonfluent aphasia (39.1\%) (P = .005
	for frontotemporal dementia vs progressive nonfluent aphasia and
	P = .002 for semantic dementia vs progressive nonfluent aphasia).
	Generally, the demographic features and diagnostic categories of
	the patient populations across the 3 sites were comparable. There
	were 68 deaths and 37 autopsies. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	with ubiquitin-positive tau-negative inclusions (48.5\%), dementia
	lacking distinctive histopathological features (18.2\%), and Pick
	disease (15.2\%) were the most common neuropathological diagnoses.
	CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that cohorts of patients can be
	combined using new research criteria for FTLD and demonstrate striking
	demographic differences among FTLD subgroups. The sex and age-at-onset
	differences suggest that there may be biological differences among
	FTLD subgroups. In this sample, FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	accounted for half of all neuropathological diagnoses.},

	(FTLDs), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration
	(CBD). METHODS: The authors conducted pathologic reexamination with
	the most recent immunohistochemistry of all cases diagnosed with
	FTLD, PSP, and CBD between 1970 and 2004. The authors also reviewed
	the early clinical features for clinical diagnosis and application
	of published research criteria. RESULTS: Of 127 cases analyzed, 57
	had a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD, 49 PSP, and 21 CBD. Of these,
	38 were clinically reclassified as frontal variant frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD), 13 as progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), 21 as
	CBD-like, 33 as PSP-like, and 13 with frontotemporal dementia with
	coexisting motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). The authors were unable
	to classify nine cases. All cases of FTD-MND were tau-negative and
	had pathologic evidence of motor neuron degeneration. All cases classified
	as PSP-like or CBD-like had tau-positive pathology. Of the 13 cases
	with PNFA, PSP and CBD accounted for almost 70\% of the cases, while
	FTD was almost equally divided between tau-positive and tau-negative
	diseases. CONCLUSION: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, corticobasal
	degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have
	overlapping clinical features. The prediction of tau-positive pathology
	from a CBD or PSP-like presentation is good, while the frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD)-motor neuron disease syndrome almost certainly predicts
	motor neuron degeneration. Surprisingly, PSP and CBD accounted for
	most cases classified as progressive non-fluent aphasia. Frontal
	variant FTD is an unpredictable disease in terms of its biochemistry.},

	function during tumor resection around the frontotemporal regions
	of the dominant hemisphere. The aim of this study was to visualize
	language-related subcortical connections, such as the arcuate fasciculus
	(AF) by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography. METHODS:
	Twenty-two patients with brain lesions adjacent to the AF in the
	frontotemporal regions of the dominant hemisphere were studied. The
	AF tractography was accomplished by placing initiation and termination
	sites (seed and target points) in the frontal and temporal regions,
	which were functionally identified by using functional magnetic resonance
	(fMR) imaging in conjunction with a verb generation task and magnetoencephalography
	(MEG) in conjunction with a reading task. The combination of fMR
	imaging and MEG data clearly demonstrated the hemispheric dominance
	of language functions, which was confirmed by an intracranial amobarbital
	test (Wada procedure). In all 22 patients, the authors were able
	to consistently visualize the AF by DT imaging-based tractography,
	using the functionally identified seed and target points and a fractional
	anisotropy value of 0.16. In two of 22 cases investigated, the functional
	information, including the results of AF tractography, fMR imaging,
	and MEG, was imported to a neuronavigation system and was validated
	by bipolar electric stimulation of the cortical and subcortical areas
	during awake surgery. The cortical stimulation to the gyrus that
	included the area of activation identified in fMR imaging with the
	language task evoked speech arrest, while the subcortical stimulation
	close to the AF reproducibly caused paranomia without speech arrest.
	Postoperative AF tractography showed that the distances between the
	stimulus points and the AF were within 6 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The combination
	of these techniques facilitated accurate identification of the location
	of the AF and verification of the language fibers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The status of imaging findings in the clinical diagnosis
	of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains uncertain; while they may
	be supportive of a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, they are
	not mandatory. Our aim was to assess patterns of lobar atrophy in
	a large sample of clinically defined, prospectively studied, patients
	using a magnetic resonance image (MRI) rating scale, to (1) determine
	whether imaging findings warrant a more prominent position in FTD
	diagnosis and (2) correlate the extent of lobar atrophy with clinical
	data. METHODS: We adapted a recently devised post mortem rating scale
	for FTD to rate lobar atrophy on MRI scans. The areas rated included
	the frontal cortex and both anterior and posterior temporal regions
	bilaterally. All available brain scans from all patients seen in
	the Cambridge Dementia Clinic (n = 258) diagnosed as having FTD,
	together with controls (n = 20), were used to assess the reliability
	of the method. A subset of these (n = 121) were used for clinico-anatomic
	analysis. RESULTS: The scale proved quick and reliable (intra-, inter-rater
	k = 0.80, 0.67). MRI scans were abnormal in the majority of patients
	(75\%), with focal atrophy present in 100\% of semantic dementia
	(SD) patients. By contrast, nearly half (47\%) of the patients with
	clinical behavioural variant FTD had scans within the normal range.
	Behavioural cases with normal scans generally had fewer cognitive
	deficits and milder functional impairment than those with abnormal
	scans, yet displayed a clinically indistinguishable behavioural syndrome.
	They were not, however, simply at an earlier stage of the disease.
	CONCLUSIONS: MRI findings should form part of the diagnostic criteria
	for SD; the absence of atrophy on MRI in many behavioural cases raises
	the prospect that the behavioural syndrome of FTD is not specific
	for patients with a neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by a known genetic mutation and so
	potentially can be diagnosed many years before the onset of symptoms.
	Neuropathological changes have been found in both striatum and frontal
	cortex in the pre-symptomatic stage. Disruption of cortico-striatal
	white matter fibre tracts is therefore likely to contribute to the
	first clinical signs of the disease. We analysed diffusion tensor
	MR image (DTI) data from 25 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs)
	and 20 matched controls using a multivariate support vector machine
	to identify patterns of changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). In
	addition, we performed probabilistic fibre tracking to detect changes
	in 'streamlines' connecting frontal cortex to striatum. We found
	a pattern of structural brain changes that includes putamen bilaterally
	as well as anterior parts of the corpus callosum. This pattern was
	sufficiently specific to enable us to correctly classify 82\% of
	scans as coming from a PSC or control subject. Fibre tracking revealed
	a reduction of frontal cortico-fugal streamlines reaching the body
	of the caudate in PSCs compared to controls. In the left hemispheres
	of PSCs we found a negative correlation between years to estimated
	disease onset and streamlines from frontal cortex to body of caudate.
	A large proportion of the fibres to the caudate body originate from
	the frontal eye fields, which play an important role in the control
	of voluntary saccades. This type of saccade is specifically impaired
	in PSCs and is an early clinical sign of motor abnormalities. A correlation
	analysis in 14 PSCs revealed that subjects with greater impairment
	of voluntary-guided saccades had fewer fibre tracking streamlines
	connecting the frontal cortex and caudate body. Our findings suggest
	a specific patho-physiological basis for these symptoms by indicating
	selective vulnerability of the associated white matter tracts.},

	The FBI is a standardized behavioral questionnaire useful in the
	diagnosis and quantification of the personality and behavior disorder
	{F}{T}{D}. METHOD: Patients who had three consecutive yearly assessments
	with the FBI were selected, 12 with the behavioral variant of {F}{T}{D}
	({F}{T}{D}-bv) and 14 with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). RESULTS:
	FBI scores rose as the disease progressed in both the {F}{T}{D}-bv
	and PPA groups over the 3 years of testing. Initial mean FBI scores
	of the {F}{T}{D}-bv group were above the cutoff for {F}{T}{D} as
	established for this diagnosis with previous standardization. By
	the third year, the mean FBI score of PPA patients was also above
	the established cutoff for {F}{T}{D}. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of
	the study demonstrates that the FBI is sensitive to changes in behavior

	has developed brief, comprehensive, and reliable batteries of clinical
	and neuropsychological tests for assessment of patients with the

	these batteries in a standardized manner to more than 350 subjects
	with a diagnosis of {A}{D} and 275 control subjects who were enrolled
	in a nationwide registry by a consortium of 16 university medical
	centers. The tests selected for this study measured the primary cognitive
	manifestations of {A}{D} across a range of severity of the disorder,
	and discriminated between normal subjects and those with mild and
	moderate dementia. The batteries also detected deterioration of language,
	memory, praxis, and general intellectual status in subjects returning
	for reassessment 1 year later. Interrater and test-retest reliabilities
	were substantial. Long-term observations of this cohort are in progress
	in an effort to validate the clinical and neuropsychological assessments
	and to confirm the diagnosis by postmortem examinations. Although
	information on validation is limited thus far, the CERAD batteries
	appear to fill a need for a standardized, easily administered, and

	research studies as well as in clinical practice.},

	the orientation of the principal direction of diffusion defined for
	each image voxel. Running the streamline process repeatedly using
	Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates
	maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting
	the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion
	tensor in terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two candidates
	for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed
	and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions
	are generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The methods
	presented provide a generic framework for utilizing streamline methods
	to generate probabilistic maps of connectivity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second commonest degenerative
	cause of dementia under the age of 65, often presents with striking
	changes in behaviour and personality in association with frontal
	lobe atrophy. Based on the behavioural changes observed in FTD, it
	is commonly assumed that the orbitofrontal cortex is the earliest
	and most severely affected frontal sub-region. However, evidence
	to support this assumption has to date been largely lacking. METHODS:
	Using a novel volumetric MRI method, we performed a detailed volumetric
	analysis of six frontal regions in 12 subjects with the frontal or
	behavioural variant of FTD (fvFTD) and 12 age-, education- and sex-matched
	normal controls. The regions studied were: the orbitofrontal and
	insula regions (representing the orbitobasal cortex); the inferior
	and middle frontal regions (representing the dorsolateral prefrontal
	areas); and the superior frontal and anterior cingulate regions (representing
	the medial prefrontal areas). RESULTS: As a group, the fvFTD patients
	showed atrophy involving all six regions. We then segregated the
	12 patients into three sub-groups according to their overall degree
	of atrophy. In the mildest group (n = 3) all regions fell within
	2 standard deviations of normal. In the intermediate group (n = 6)
	only the orbitofrontal region (bilaterally) fell clearly outside
	the control range (>2 z scores below the control mean); the next
	most atrophic region in this group was the right insular region.
	The severe group (n = 3) had generalized atrophy throughout the frontal
	regions measured. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patients with the earliest
	stages of fvFTD show no significant loss of volume in any frontal
	lobe area as measured by a novel MRI volumetric technique. When volume
	loss does occur, changes are initially seen in the orbitofrontal
	cortex before atrophy becomes more widespread. These results provide
	some partial support for the often-quoted assumption that the orbitofrontal
	cortex is the locus of earliest pathology in fvFTD, although these
	findings must be regarded as preliminary in view of the small numbers
	of patients involved.},

  abstract = {This article illustrates how functional neuroimaging can be used to
	test the validity of neurological and cognitive models of language.
	Three models of language are described: the 19th Century neurological
	model which describes both the anatomy and cognitive components of
	auditory and visual word processing, and 2 20th Century cognitive
	models that are not constrained by anatomy but emphasise 2 different
	routes to reading that are not present in the neurological model.
	A series of functional imaging studies are then presented which show
	that, as predicted by the 19th Century neurologists, auditory and
	visual word repetition engage the left posterior superior temporal
	and posterior inferior frontal cortices. More specifically, the roles
	Wernicke and Broca assigned to these regions lie respectively in
	the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the anterior insula. In
	addition, a region in the left posterior inferior temporal cortex
	is activated for word retrieval, thereby providing a second route
	to reading, as predicted by the 20th Century cognitive models. This
	region and its function may have been missed by the 19th Century
	neurologists because selective damage is rare. The angular gyrus,
	previously linked to the visual word form system, is shown to be
	part of a distributed semantic system that can be accessed by objects
	and faces as well as speech. Other components of the semantic system
	include several regions in the inferior and middle temporal lobes.
	From these functional imaging results, a new anatomically constrained
	model of word processing is proposed which reconciles the anatomical
	ambitions of the 19th Century neurologists and the cognitive finesse
	of the 20th Century cognitive models. The review focuses on single
	word processing and does not attempt to discuss how words are combined
	to generate sentences or how several languages are learned and interchanged.
	Progress in unravelling these and other related issues will depend
	on the integration of behavioural, computational and neurophysiological
	approaches, including neuroimaging.},

	Both groups showed a similar spectrum of behavioral abnormalities,

	a previous functional neuroimaging study, PPA patients were found
	to activate core language areas similarly to control subjects when
	performing semantic and phonological processing tasks (Sonty et al.,
	2003). In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to study multiregional
	effective connectivity in early-stage PPA (n = 8) and control (n
	= 8) subjects performing semantic word matching and visual letter
	matching tasks. fMRI analysis showed semantic task-specific activations
	in the left inferior frontal (Broca's area) and posterior superior
	temporal (Wernicke's area) regions, in addition to other language
	regions, in both groups. Using a model language network consisting
	of six left hemisphere regions, the DCM analysis demonstrated reduced
	language-specific effective connectivity between Wernicke's and Broca's
	areas in the PPA patient group. Furthermore, this decrement in connectivity
	was predictive of semantic task accuracy. These results demonstrate
	for the first time that dysfunctional network interactions (effective
	connectivity), rather than hypoactivity within individual brain regions,
	may contribute to the emergence of language deficits seen in PPA.},

	brain regions, sparing sensorimotor cortices. The shifting deficits

	with progressively declining cognitive status (p < 0.0006). Novel
	brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of

	technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution
	across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined
	sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary
	tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing
	deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal
	regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later
	(>15\% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of {A}{D} and
	differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates
	(5.3 +/- 2.3\% per year in {A}{D} v 0.9 +/- 0.9\% per year in controls)
	were faster in the left hemisphere (p < 0.029) than the right. Transient

	the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic
	rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.},

	deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain. It is likely that future
	treatment trials will target the underlying protein biochemistry
	and it is therefore increasingly important to be able to distinguish
	between different pathologies during life. The aim of this study
	was to determine whether rates of brain atrophy differ in neurodegenerative
	dementias that vary by pathological diagnoses and characteristic
	protein biochemistry. Fifty-six autopsied subjects were identified
	with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and two serial head MRI. Subjects
	were subdivided based on pathological diagnoses into Alzheimer's
	disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB,
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive
	changes (FTLD-U), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive
	supranuclear palsy (PSP). Twenty-five controls were matched by age,
	gender and scan interval, to the study cohort. The boundary-shift
	integral was used to calculate change over time in whole brain (BBSI)
	and ventricular volume (VBSI). All BSI results were annualized by
	adjusting for scan interval. The rates of whole brain atrophy and
	ventricular expansion were significantly increased compared to controls
	in the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, FTLD-U,
	CBD and PSP groups. However, atrophy rates in the DLB group were
	not significantly different from control rates of atrophy. The largest
	rates of atrophy were observed in the CBD group which had a BBSI
	of 2.3\% and VBSI of 16.2\%. The CBD group had significantly greater
	rates of BBSI and VBSI than the DLB, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB,
	Alzheimer's disease and PSP groups, with a similar trend observed
	when compared to the FTLD-U group. The FTLD-U group showed the next
	largest rates with a BBSI of 1.7\% and VBSI of 9.6\% which were both
	significantly greater than the DLB group. There was no significant
	difference in the rates of atrophy between the Alzheimer's disease,
	mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and PSP groups, which all showed similar
	rates of atrophy; BBSI of 1.1, 1.3 and 1.0\% and VBSI of 8.3, 7.2
	and 10.9\%, respectively. Rates of atrophy therefore differ according
	to the pathological diagnoses and underlying protein biochemistry.
	While rates are unlikely to be useful in differentiating Alzheimer's
	disease from cases with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB pathology,
	they demonstrate important pathophysiological differences between
	DLB and those with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and Alzheimer's
	disease pathology, and between those with CBD and PSP pathology.},

	different pathologic substrates of FTD have distinct patterns of
	regional atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DESIGN: Retrospective
	case study. SETTING: The Institute of Neurology, University College
	London, and the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London.Patients
	Twenty-one cases of FTD selected on pathologic grounds (9 with ubiquitin-positive
	[tau- and alpha-synuclein-negative] inclusions [FTD-U], 7 with Pick
	disease [PiD], and 5 with familial FTD with tau exon 10+16 mutations
	[tau exon 10+16]) and 20 healthy controls were studied. MAIN OUTCOME
	MEASURES: Patterns of gray matter atrophy in each group as assessed
	by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and a blinded visual assessment
	of each MRI study. RESULTS: All pathologic substrates were associated
	with atrophy that involved the inferior and medial temporal and inferior
	frontal lobes. Additionally, specific VBM signatures were identified
	for each subgroup: FTD-U was associated with asymmetric (left > right)
	temporal lobe atrophy, PiD was associated with severe dorsolateral
	bifrontal atrophy, and tau exon 10+16 was associated with asymmetric
	(right > left) medial temporal lobe atrophy. The VBM findings were
	supported by blinded visual assessment. CONCLUSION: These findings
	suggest that MRI patterns of regional gray matter atrophy constitute
	signatures of tissue pathology in FTD.},

	(FTD) has never been systematically studied using diffusion-weighted
	imaging (DWI). We studied FTD patients using DWI to determine whether
	microstructural changes in white matter can be detected in vivo.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen FTD patients and 15 aged healthy
	subjects were studied. Mean diffusivity (MD) abnormalities in 28
	white matter regions were visually evaluated. In addition, MD values
	in 10 white matter regions relative to that in the ipsilateral postcentral
	gyrus were measured. The results were compared between healthy subjects
	and FTD patients. RESULTS: The visual rating resulted in a significant
	MD elevation in FTD patients in the bilateral high superior frontal
	gyri, right orbitofrontal gyrus, bilateral anterior temporal lobes,
	and left middle temporal lobe (P < .01, respectively). Relative MD
	comparison revealed a significant MD elevation in FTD patients in
	the bilateral high superior frontal gyri, bilateral orbitofrontal
	gyri, and bilateral anterior temporal lobes (P < .05 after Bonferroni
	correction, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated white
	matter MD abnormalities in FTD patients. It was suggested that the
	observed white matter MD abnormalities are secondary to damage in
	the overlying cortex.},

	easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with
	little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods
	and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides
	the results of validation experiments performed in the context of
	an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes
	SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics
	for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable
	and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for
	lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel deformable registration algorithm
	for diffusion tensor MR images that enables explicit optimization
	of tensor reorientation. The optimization seeks a piecewise affine
	transformation that divides the image domain into uniform regions
	and transform each region affinely. The objective function captures
	both the image similarity and the smoothness of the transformation
	across region boundaries. The image similarity enables explicit orientation
	optimization by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary
	for warping diffusion tensor images. The objective function is formulated
	in a way that allows explicit implementation of analytic derivatives
	to drive fast and accurate optimization using the conjugate gradient
	method. By explicitly optimizing tensor reorientation, the algorithm
	is designed to take advantage of similarity measures comparing tensors
	as a whole. The optimal transformation is hierarchically refined
	in a subdivision framework. A comparison with affine registration
	for inter-subject normalization of 8 subjects shows that the proposed
	algorithm improves the alignment of several major white matter structures
	examined: the anterior thalamic radiations, the inferior fronto-occipital
	fasciculi, the corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts and the genu and
	the splenium of the corpus callosum. The alignment of white matter
	structures is assessed using a novel scheme of computing distances
	between the corresponding fiber bundles derived from tractography.},

  abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed
	characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal
	atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These
	spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related
	diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease
	(AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here,
	we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for
	maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic
	maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this
	optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method.
	Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to
	contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with
	the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The
	new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular
	when the distance between the template brain and the target brain
	is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic
	cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained
	by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods
	tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated
	with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates
	that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing
	and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients
	and at-risk elderly individuals.},
