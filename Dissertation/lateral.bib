  abstract = {Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks.
	Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers
	in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation
	matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical
	and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation
	matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks,
	we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient
	in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length
	(2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network,
	whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters
	have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the
	macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical
	core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated
	power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions
	of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections
	to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal
	association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were
	topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to
	targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network,
	but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated,
	low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world
	architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity
	of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical
	for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate
	for segregated and distributed information processing.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) is an emerging imaging modality
	whose importance has been growing considerably. However, the processing
	of this type of data (i.e., symmetric positive-definite matrices),
	called "tensors" here, has proved difficult in recent years. Usual
	Euclidean operations on matrices suffer from many defects on tensors,
	which have led to the use of many ad hoc methods. Recently, affine-invariant
	Riemannian metrics have been proposed as a rigorous and general framework
	in which these defects are corrected. These metrics have excellent
	theoretical properties and provide powerful processing tools, but
	also lead in practice to complex and slow algorithms. To remedy this
	limitation, a new family of Riemannian metrics called Log-Euclidean
	is proposed in this article. They also have excellent theoretical
	properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler
	and faster computations. This new approach is based on a novel vector
	space structure for tensors. In this framework, Riemannian computations
	can be converted into Euclidean ones once tensors have been transformed
	into their matrix logarithms. Theoretical aspects are presented and
	the Euclidean, affine-invariant, and Log-Euclidean frameworks are
	compared experimentally. The comparison is carried out on interpolation
	and regularization tasks on synthetic and clinical 3D DTI data.},

  abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI consists of deriving and displaying
	parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e.,
	that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and
	microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and
	insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here,
	these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion
	isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel
	measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from
	the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel.
	First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts,
	[D] I and D - [D] I, respectively (where [D] = Trace(D)/3 is the
	mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor
	(dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally
	and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these
	quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion
	tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series
	of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain.
	Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes
	in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and
	organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications
	include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and
	disease.},

	to show their application to the tractography algorithm developed
	in our unit, fast marching tractography (FMT). FMT estimates anatomical
	connectivity between brain regions using the information provided
	by diffusion tensor imaging. Three major white-matter pathways were
	investigated in 11 normal subjects--anterior callosal fibers, optic
	radiations, and pyramidal tracts. FMT was used to generate maps of
	connectivity metric, and regions of voxels with highest connectivity
	metric to an anatomically defined starting point were identified
	for each tract under investigation. The reproducibilities of tract-"normalized"
	volume (NV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements were assessed
	over such regions. The values of tract volumes are consistent with
	the postmortem data. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for FA and NV
	ranged from 1.7 to 7.1\% and from 2.2 to 18.6\%, respectively. CVs
	were lowest in the anterior callosal fibers (range: 1.7- 7.8\%),
	followed by the optic radiations (range: 1.2-18.6\%) and pyramidal
	tracts (range: 2.6-15.5\%), suggesting that fiber organization plays
	a role in determining the level of FMT reproducibility. In conclusion,
	these findings underline the importance of assessing the reliability

  abstract = {Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become the major imaging
	modality to study properties of white matter and the geometry of
	fiber tracts of the human brain. Clinical studies mostly focus on
	regional statistics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
	(MD) derived from tensors. Existing analysis techniques do not sufficiently
	take into account that the measurements are tensors, and thus require
	proper interpolation and statistics of tensors, and that regions
	of interest are fiber tracts with complex spatial geometry. We propose
	a new framework for quantitative tract-oriented DTI analysis that
	systematically includes tensor interpolation and averaging, using
	nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. A new measure of tensor anisotropy,
	called geodesic anisotropy (GA) is applied and compared with FA.
	As a result, tracts of interest are represented by the geometry of
	the medial spine attributed with tensor statistics (average and variance)
	calculated within cross-sections. Feasibility of our approach is
	demonstrated on various fiber tracts of a single data set. A validation

	including both the geometry of major fiber bundles as well as quantitative
	information about tissue properties represented by derived tensor
	measures. This paper presents a method for statistical comparison
	of fiber bundle diffusion properties between populations of diffusion
	tensor images. Unbiased diffeomorphic atlas building is used to compute
	a normalized coordinate system for populations of diffusion images.
	The diffeomorphic transformations between each subject and the atlas
	provide spatial normalization for the comparison of tract statistics.
	Diffusion properties, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and tensor
	norm, along fiber tracts are modeled as multivariate functions of
	arc length. Hypothesis testing is performed non-parametrically using
	permutation testing based on the Hotelling T(2) statistic. The linear
	discriminant embedded in the T(2) metric provides an intuitive, localized
	interpretation of detected differences. The proposed methodology
	was tested on two clinical studies of neurodevelopment. In a study
	of 1 and 2 year old subjects, a significant increase in FA and a
	correlated decrease in Frobenius norm was found in several tracts.
	Significant differences in neonates were found in the splenium tract
	between controls and subjects with isolated mild ventriculomegaly
	(MVM) demonstrating the potential of this method for clinical studies.},

	Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these

	connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network
	that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque
	neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify
	functional networks, we find structure-function relations at multiple
	temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows

	structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional
	networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant
	fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence
	of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows.
	The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time
	as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings
	between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the
	existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked
	by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying
	structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds)
	we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and
	find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes,
	contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer
	entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent
	correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

  abstract = {To understand the effects of a cortical lesion it is necessary to
	consider not only the loss of local neural function, but also the
	lesion-induced changes in the larger network of endogenous oscillatory
	interactions in the brain. To investigate how network embedding influences
	a region's functional role, and the consequences of its being damaged,
	we implement two models of oscillatory cortical interactions, both
	of which inherit their coupling architecture from the available anatomical
	connection data for macaque cerebral cortex. In the first model,
	node dynamics are governed by Kuramoto phase oscillator equations,
	and we investigate the sequence in which areas entrain one another
	in the transition to global synchrony. In the second model, node
	dynamics are governed by a more realistic neural mass model, and
	we assess long-run inter-regional interactions using a measure of
	directed information flow. Highly connected parietal and frontal
	areas are found to synchronize most rapidly, more so than equally
	highly connected visual and somatosensory areas, and this difference
	can be explained in terms of the network's clustered architecture.
	For both models, lesion effects extend beyond the immediate neighbors
	of the lesioned site, and the amplitude and dispersal of nonlocal
	effects are again influenced by cluster patterns in the network.
	Although the consequences of in vivo lesions will always depend on
	circuitry local to the damaged site, we conclude that lesions of
	parietal regions (especially areas 5 and 7a) and frontal regions
	(especially areas 46 and FEF) have the greatest potential to disrupt
	the integrative aspects of neocortical function.},

	are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured
	using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations,
	those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional
	connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural
	(anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the
	present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling,
	whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including
	their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be
	accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network.
	We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and
	structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography)
	in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity
	then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics.
	In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections
	commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection,
	rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional
	connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional
	distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity
	that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii)
	that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within
	and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical
	and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional
	connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions
	without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and
	spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale
	anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {A new methodology based on Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging
	(DW-MRI) and Graph Theory is presented for characterizing the anatomical
	connections between brain gray matter areas. In a first step, brain
	voxels are modeled as nodes of a non-directed graph in which the
	weight of an arc linking two neighbor nodes is assumed to be proportional
	to the probability of being connected by nervous fibers. This probability
	is estimated by means of probabilistic tissue segmentation and intravoxel
	white matter orientational distribution function, obtained from anatomical
	MRI and DW-MRI, respectively. A new tractography algorithm for finding
	white matter routes is also introduced. This algorithm solves the
	most probable path problem between any two nodes, leading to the
	assessment of probabilistic brain anatomical connection maps. In
	a second step, for assessing anatomical connectivity between K gray
	matter structures, the previous graph is redefined as a K+1 partite
	graph by partitioning the initial nodes set in K non-overlapped gray
	matter subsets and one subset clustering the remaining nodes. Three
	different measures are proposed for quantifying anatomical connections
	between any pair of gray matter subsets: Anatomical Connection Strength
	(ACS), Anatomical Connection Density (ACD) and Anatomical Connection
	Probability (ACP). This methodology was applied to both artificial
	and actual human data. Results show that nervous fiber pathways between
	some regions of interest were reconstructed correctly. Additionally,
	mean connectivity maps of ACS, ACD and ACP between 71 gray matter
	structures for five healthy subjects are presented.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Recovery mechanisms supporting upper extremity motor recovery
	following stroke are well established, but cortical mechanism associated
	with lower extremity motor recovery is unknown. The aim of this study
	was to assess cortical reorganization associated with lower extremity
	motor recovery in a hemiparetic patient. METHODS: Six control subjects
	and a 17 year-old woman with left intracerebral hemorrhage due to
	an arterio-venous malformation rupture were evaluated. The motor
	function of the paretic (left) hip and knee had recovered slowly
	to the extent of her being able to overcome gravity for 10 months
	after the onset of stroke. However, her paretic upper extremity showed
	no significant motor recovery. Blood oxygenation level dependent
	(BOLD) functional MRI at 1.5 Tesla was used to determine the acutual
	location of cortical activation in the predefined regions of interest.
	Concurrently, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in combination with
	a novel 3D-fiber reconstruction algorithm was utilized to investigate
	the pattern of the corticospinal pathway connectivity between the
	areas of the motor stream. All subjects' body parts were secured
	in the scanner and performed a sequential knee flexion-extension
	with a predetermined angle of 0-60 degrees at 0.5 Hz. RESULTS: Controls
	showed anticipated activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex
	(SM1) and the descending corticospinal fibers stemming from motor
	cortex. In contrast to control normal subjects, the stroke patient
	showed fMRI activation only in the unaffected (right) primary SM1
	during either paretic or nonparetic knee movements. DTT fiber tracing
	data showed that the corticospinal tract fibers were found only in
	the unaffected hemisphere but not in the affected hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results indicate that an ipsilateral motor pathway from the unaffected
	(right) motor cortex to the paretic (right) leg was present in this
	patient. This study raises the potential that the contralesional
	(ipsilateral) SM1 is involved in cortical reorganization associated
	lower extremity motor recovery in stroke. This study is the first
	neuroimaging evidence that the combined fMRI and DTI fiber tracing
	can significantly expand the explanatory power of probing cortical
	reorganization underlying motor recovery mechanism in stroke.},

	MRI (DT-MRI) data in a number of studies. In VBM, following spatial
	normalization, data are smoothed to improve the validity of statistical
	inferences and to reduce inter-individual variation. However, the
	size of the smoothing filter used for VBM of DT-MRI data is highly
	variable across studies. For example, a literature review revealed
	that Gaussian smoothing kernels ranging in size (full width at half
	maximum) from zero to 16 mm have been used in DT-MRI VBM type studies.
	To investigate the effect of varying filter size in such analyses,
	whole brain DT-MRI data from 14 schizophrenic patients were compared
	with those of 14 matched control subjects using VBM, when the filter
	size was varied from zero to 16 mm. Within this range of smoothing,
	four different conclusions regarding apparent patient control differences
	could be made: (i) no significant patient-control differences; (ii)
	reduced FA in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in patients; (iii)
	reduced FA in both right STG and left cerebellum in patients; and

	Anatomical connectivity in white matter is obtained from measurements

	probability of a jump in a particular direction from a given voxel
	being based on the local value of the diffusion tensor components.
	Functional connectivity between grey matter pixels is assessed without
	recourse to a specific activation paradigm, by calculating the correlation
	coefficient between random fluctuations in the blood oxygenation
	level-dependent signal time course in different pixels. The methods
	are used to examine the anatomical and functional connectivities
	between crowns of adjacent gyri. A high functional connectivity was
	found between grey matter pixels, with white matter displaying only
	very low correlation. A comparison of the measurements of anatomical
	and functional connectivity found that there is no simple correlation
	between these measures, except that low values of functional connectivity
	were not found together with high values of anatomical connectivity.
	Furthermore pairs of regions situated around the central sulcus indicated
	a dependence of the two connectivity measures on each other. These
	results are in accordance with an interpretation that regions which
	are clearly directly linked by white matter fiber tracts should show
	high functional connectivity, but that the inverse need not be true

  abstract = {In this study, we introduced a length-normalized parameterization
	method to establish anatomical correspondence of white matter fiber
	tracts across subjects and applied this method to investigate the
	presence of abnormal diffusion along the pyramidal tract (PYT) of
	relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) patients without visible brain
	lesions. In this approach, the part of the PYT between the lowest
	slice of the cerebral peduncle and the uppermost slice of the lateral
	ventricle was reconstructed to establish the anatomical correspondence
	across subjects using diffusion tensor tractography. Then it was
	parameterized by normalizing its length and dividing equally the
	normalized length into a certain number of segments, so that the
	comparability of each segment across subjects along the PYT was established.
	Tract-specific diffusion indices, including directionally averaged
	diffusivity (D(av)), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary diffusivity
	(lambda(1)) and transverse diffusivity (lambda(23)), were obtained
	from each segment. Thus, the distribution maps of these indices along
	the PYT were obtained. The distribution maps of D(av), FA, and lambda(23)
	of RNMO patients were significantly different from those of healthy
	controls, especially in the lower part of the PYT. The differences
	may be caused by secondary degeneration to lesions in the spinal
	cord. In conclusion, a length-normalized parameterization method
	is proposed to establish anatomical correspondence for the PYT. Compared
	with existed methods, a major merit of our method is to provide comparability
	across subjects along the PYT on the basis of diffusion tensor tractography
	and to make it possible for the quantitative analysis along the fiber
	tract. This method can also be used to quantitatively analyze other
	white matter fiber tracts between two definite anatomic landmarks
	in many neurological or psychiatric diseases.},

	mapping of white matter fiber pathways. Knowledge of the point correspondence
	along the fiber pathways is not only necessary for accurate clustering
	of the trajectories into fiber bundles, but also crucial for any
	tract-oriented quantitative analysis. We employ an expectation-maximization
	(EM) algorithm to cluster the trajectories in a gamma mixture model
	context. The result of clustering is the probabilistic assignment
	of the fiber trajectories to each cluster, an estimate of the cluster
	parameters, i.e. spatial mean and variance, and point correspondences.
	The fiber bundles are modeled by the mean trajectory and its spatial
	variation. Point-by-point correspondence of the trajectories within
	a bundle is obtained by constructing a distance map and a label map
	from each cluster center at every iteration of the EM algorithm.
	This offers a time-efficient alternative to pairwise curve matching
	of all trajectories with respect to each cluster center. The proposed
	method has the potential to benefit from an anatomical atlas of fiber
	tracts by incorporating it as prior information in the EM algorithm.
	The algorithm is also capable of handling outliers in a principled
	way. The presented results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness

	a quantitative comparison of fiber coordinate systems from the literature

	asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and cingulum bundle (CB).
	The results of this study demonstrate that TBM can detect differences

	entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD) differences found
	in AF. We report TBM results of higher fractional anisotropy (FA)

	the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left AF),
	and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to higher lambda(1),
	the largest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left CB).
	By mapping the significance levels onto the tractography trajectories

	aged 8-18 years were investigated. Brain activity was measured using
	the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast with functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a working
	memory (WM) task. White matter microstructure was investigated using
	diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Based on the DTI data, we calculated
	fractional anisotropy (FA), an indicator of myelination and axon
	thickness. Prior to scanning, WM score was evaluated. WM score correlated
	independently with FA values and BOLD response in several regions.
	FA values and BOLD response were extracted for each subject from
	the peak voxels of these regions. The FA values were used as covariates
	in an additional BOLD analysis to find brain regions where FA values
	and BOLD response correlated. Conversely, the BOLD response values
	were used as covariates in an additional FA analysis. In several
	cortical and sub-cortical regions, there were positive correlations
	between maturation of white matter and increased brain activity.
	Specifically, and consistent with our hypothesis, we found that FA

	in preservation of motor function in patients with brain tumors.
	The goal of the present study was to investigate whether function
	of the primary motor area (M1) was restored and whether motor function
	improved after brain tumor resection. METHODS: Five patients with
	metastatic brain tumors located within or near M1 underwent awake
	surgery with intraoperative cortical mapping and continuous task
	monitoring. Preoperative and postoperative functional MR imaging
	(fMRI) was performed during hand clenching, and diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) was performed in 1 case to further characterize the
	area activated in fMRI. RESULTS: Preoperative fMRI performed during
	hand clenching demonstrated reorganization of motor function. In
	patients with severe paresis (cases 3, 4, and 5), clenching of the
	affected hand induced a large blood oxygen level-dependent response
	in the right hemisphere, mainly in the anterior temporal lobe, despite
	the location site of the tumor. Postoperative fMRI during hand clenching
	demonstrated activation of the contralateral M1. Furthermore, in
	case 5, DTI detected tracts, possibly the inferior longitudinal fasciculus,
	arising from anterior temporal activated area as well as tracts connecting
	the premotor and M1 activated area. This patient demonstrated mirror
	movement of the hand during the course of motor function recovery.
	CONCLUSIONS: Tumor resection resulted in restoration of M1 function
	and improved motor function in patients with preoperative reorganization
	of M1 function. Furthermore, the preoperative reorganization of motor
	function in cases with severe paresis may be related to changes in
	the right hemisphere, including the temporal lobe.},

	(RSTC) are two leading techniques for investigating the connectivity
	of the human brain. They have been widely used to investigate the
	strength of anatomical and functional connections between distant
	brain regions in healthy subjects, and in clinical populations. Though
	they are both based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) they have
	not yet been compared directly. In this work both techniques were
	employed to create global connectivity matrices covering the whole
	brain gray matter. This allowed for direct comparisons between functional
	connectivity measured by RSTC with anatomical connectivity quantified
	using DTI tractography. We found that connectivity matrices obtained
	using both techniques showed significant agreement. Connectivity
	maps created for a priori defined anatomical regions showed significant
	correlation, and furthermore agreement was especially high in regions
	showing strong overall connectivity, such as those belonging to the
	default mode network. Direct comparison between functional RSTC and
	anatomical DTI connectivity, presented here for the first time, links
	two powerful approaches for investigating brain connectivity and
	shows their strong agreement. It provides a crucial multi-modal validation
	for resting state correlations as representing neuronal connectivity.
	The combination of both techniques presented here allows for further
	combining them to provide richer representation of brain connectivity

	imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the
	brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter
	tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion
	data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly
	directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are
	starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order
	to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and
	disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard
	registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory
	solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple
	subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from
	the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness
	of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved.
	In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues
	via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b)
	projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the
	"mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based
	Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity,

	We examine these connection patterns by calculating a broad range

  abstract = {Brain regions in the mammalian cerebral cortex are linked by a complex

	focus on the identification and classification of hub regions, which
	are thought to play pivotal roles in the coordination of information
	flow. We identify hubs and characterize their network contributions
	by examining motif fingerprints and centrality indices for all regions
	within the cerebral cortices of both the cat and the macaque. Motif
	fingerprints capture the statistics of local connection patterns,
	while measures of centrality identify regions that lie on many of
	the shortest paths between parts of the network. Within both cat
	and macaque networks, we find that a combination of degree, motif
	participation, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality allows
	for reliable identification of hub regions, many of which have previously
	been functionally classified as polysensory or multimodal. We then
	classify hubs as either provincial (intra-cluster) hubs or connector
	(inter-cluster) hubs, and proceed to show that lesioning hubs of
	each type from the network produces opposite effects on the small-world
	index. Our study presents an approach to the identification and classification

	tonotopic organization in PAC and found similar organization as that
	described in mammals. In contrast to what is known about PAC in primates
	and nonprimates, in humans, the structural connectivity within PAC
	has not been defined. In this study, stroboscopic event-related functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to reveal mirror symmetric
	tonotopic organization consisting of a high-low-high frequency gradient
	in PAC. Furthermore, diffusion tensor tractography and probabilistic
	mapping was used to study projection patterns within tonotopic areas.
	Based on earlier physiological and histological work in nonhuman
	PAC, we hypothesized the existence of cross-field isofrequency (homotopic)
	and within-field non-isofrequency (heterotopic)-specific axonal projections
	in human PAC. The presence of both projections types was found in
	all subjects. Specifically, the number of diffusion tensor imaging
	(DTI) reconstructed fibers projecting between high- and low-frequency
	regions was greater than those fibers projecting between 2 high-frequency
	areas, the latter of which are located in distinct auditory fields.
	The fMRI and DTI results indicate that functional and structural
	properties within early stages of the auditory processing stream
	are preserved across multiple mammalian species at distinct evolutionary

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recovery from focal motor pathway lesions may be associated
	with a functional reorganisation of cortical motor areas. Previous
	studies of the relation between structural brain damage and the functional
	consequences have employed MRI and CT, which provide limited structural
	information. The recent development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	now provides quantitative measures of fibre tract integrity and orientation.
	The objective was to use DTI and functional MRI (fMRI) to determine
	the mechanisms underlying the excellent recovery found after a penetrating
	injury to the right capsular region. METHODS: DTI and fMRI were performed
	on the patient described; DTI was performed on five normal controls.
	RESULTS: The injury resulted in a left hemiplegia which resolved
	fully over several weeks. When studied 18 months later there was
	no pyramidal weakness, a mild hemidystonia, and sensory disturbance.
	fMRI activation maps showed contralateral primary and supplementary
	motor cortex activation during tapping of each hand; smaller ipsilateral
	primary motor areas were activated by the recovered hand only. DTI
	disclosed preserved structural integrity and orientation in the posterior
	capsular limb by contrast with the disrupted structure in the anterior
	limb on the injured side. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that
	the main recovery mechanism was a preservation of the integrity and
	orientation of pyramidal tract fibres. The fMRI studies do not suggest
	substantial reorganisation of the motor cortex, although ipsilateral
	pathways may have contributed to the recovery. The initial deficit
	was probably due to reversible local factors including oedema and
	mass effect; permanent damage to fibre tracts in the anterior capsular
	limb may account for the persistent sensory deficit. This study shows
	for the first time the potential value of combining fMRI and DTI
	together to investigate mechanisms of recovery and persistent deficit
	in an individual patient.},

	The noise variability of nonlinear quantities of the diffusion tensor

	quantified using the bootstrap, in which the data are resampled from
	the experimental averages, yet this approach is only applicable to
	DTI scans that contain multiple averages from the same sampling direction.
	It has been shown that DTI acquisitions with a modest to large number
	of directions, in which each direction is only sampled once, outperform
	the multiple averages approach. These acquisitions resist the traditional
	(regular) bootstrap analysis though. In contrast to the regular bootstrap,
	the wild bootstrap method can be applied to such protocols in which
	there is only one observation per direction. Here, we compare and
	contrast the wild bootstrap with the regular bootstrap using Monte
	Carlo numerical simulations for a number of diffusion scenarios.
	The regular and wild bootstrap methods are applied to human DTI data
	and empirical distributions are obtained for fractional anisotropy
	and the diffusion tensor eigensystem. Spatial maps of the estimated
	variability in the diffusion tensor principal eigenvector are provided.
	The wild bootstrap method can provide empirical distributions for
