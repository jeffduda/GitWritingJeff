  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) is an emerging imaging modality
	whose importance has been growing considerably. However, the processing
	of this type of data (i.e., symmetric positive-definite matrices),
	called "tensors" here, has proved difficult in recent years. Usual
	Euclidean operations on matrices suffer from many defects on tensors,
	which have led to the use of many ad hoc methods. Recently, affine-invariant
	Riemannian metrics have been proposed as a rigorous and general framework
	in which these defects are corrected. These metrics have excellent
	theoretical properties and provide powerful processing tools, but
	also lead in practice to complex and slow algorithms. To remedy this
	limitation, a new family of Riemannian metrics called Log-Euclidean
	is proposed in this article. They also have excellent theoretical
	properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler
	and faster computations. This new approach is based on a novel vector
	space structure for tensors. In this framework, Riemannian computations
	can be converted into Euclidean ones once tensors have been transformed
	into their matrix logarithms. Theoretical aspects are presented and
	the Euclidean, affine-invariant, and Log-Euclidean frameworks are
	compared experimentally. The comparison is carried out on interpolation
	and regularization tasks on synthetic and clinical 3D DTI data.},

  abstract = {We present a unified method, based on symmetric diffeomorphisms, for
	studying longitudinal neurodegeneration. Our method first uses symmetric
	diffeomorphic normalization to find a spatiotemporal parameterization
	of an individual's image time series. The second step involves mapping
	a representative image or set of images from the time series into
	an optimal template space. The template mapping is then combined
	with the intrasubject spatiotemporal map to enable pairwise statistical
	tests to be performed on a population of normalized time series images.
	Here, we apply this longitudinal analysis protocol to study the gray
	matter atrophy patterns induced by frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
	We sample our normalized spatiotemporal maps at baseline (time zero)
	and time one year to generate an annualized atrophy map (AAM) that
	estimates the annual effect of FTD. This spatiotemporal normalization
	enables us to locate neuroanatomical regions that consistently undergo
	significant annual gray matter atrophy across the population. We
	found the majority of annual atrophy to occur in the frontal and
	temporal lobes in our population of 20 subjects. We also found significant
	effects in the hippocampus, insula and cingulate gyrus. Our novel
	results, significant at p < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction,
	are represented in local template space but also assigned Talairach
	coordinates and Brodmann and Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL)

  abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed
	characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal
	atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These
	spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related
	diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease
	(AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here,
	we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for
	maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic
	maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this
	optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method.
	Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to
	contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with
	the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The
	new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular
	when the distance between the template brain and the target brain
	is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic
	cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained
	by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods
	tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated
	with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates
	that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing
	and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients

	for cocaine use at term). We use advanced image registration and

	Our results indicate that the caudate is significantly larger in

  abstract = {Nonrigid medical image registration between images that are linked
	by an invertible transformation is an inherently symmetric problem.
	The transformation that registers the image pair should ideally be
	the inverse of the transformation that registers the pair with the
	order of images interchanged. This property is referred to as symmetry
	in registration or inverse consistent registration. However, in practical
	estimation, the available registration algorithms have tended to
	produce inverse inconsistent transformations when the template and

	cost functions in the large deformation diffeomorphic framework that

	terms; in the first, the matching error is measured at all points
	along the flow between template and target, and in the second, matching
	is enforced only at the midpoint of the flow between the template
	and target. We have implemented these cost functions and present
	experimental results to validate their inverse consistent property

	16 C, 6 CI, and 7 D subjects of comparable age were studied with
	{M}{R}{I} twice, at least 1 year apart. Longitudinal change in total
	brain size was measured by several methods, including computerized
	segmentation, non-linear warping, and change in the fluid/tissue
	boundaries between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain. Change in
	hippocampal volume was measured by semi-automated methods, and ERC
	volumes were manually measured. RESULTS: The annual rate of atrophy
	was greater in D versus C and D versus CI for cortical gray matter
	(cGM) (P=0.009 and 0.002), hippocampus (P=0.0001 and 0.002), and
	for the change in the fluid/tissue boundary (P=0.03 and 0.03). The
	annual rate of atrophy of ERC was greater in both CI and D versus
	C (P=0.01 and 0.0002). No significant differences between groups
	were found using non-linear warping. CONCLUSIONS: In CI, the greatest
	annual rates of atrophy were in ERC, while in D the greatest annual
	rates of atrophy were in hippocampus and cortex. Progressive ERC
	atrophy was observed with a greater degree of cognitive impairment,
	while hippocampal and cortical atrophy were only observed in demented

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of long-term
	disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology
	in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed
	at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous
	voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural
	atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image
	normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
	study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously
	estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations
	between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns
	of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control
	and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were
	29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms
	of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses
	were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical
	nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum,
	the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant
	voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum
	and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified
	largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was
	observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis
	to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total
	lesion volume >1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and
	partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI.
	By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique
	can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse
	structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected
	to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior
	relationships in the TBI population.},

  abstract = {In the context of neuroimaging experiments, it is essential to account
	for the multiple comparisons problem when thresholding statistical
	mappings. Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but
	they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale
	effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method
	that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method
	increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature
	of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window
	technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level.
	Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved
	FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis
	of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based
	on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than
	conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown
	that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results
	in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and
	numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method
	is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based
	methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional
	FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher
	sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still
	controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally,
	our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to
	assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate regional alterations in the apparent
	diffusion coefficient (ADC) of cortical gray and white matter and
	subcortical structures that are known to be involved in mild cognitive
	impairment (MCI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance (MR)
	imaging was performed in 13 patients with MCI (nine men, four women;
	mean age, 74 years +/- 6 [standard deviation]) and 13 healthy elderly
	control subjects (seven men, six women; mean age, 75 years +/- 4).
	This study was approved by the institutional review board and was
	HIPAA compliant. Each subject gave informed consent. ADC was measured
	from manually drawn regions of interest (ROIs) of the hippocampus,
	parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, corpus callosum, and anterior and
	posterior cingulate gyrus and from automatically defined frontal,
	parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes by using template masking.
	ROIs were outlined on anatomic images then mapped onto ADC maps by
	using coregistration transformation matrix. A skeleton-based region
	competition segmentation algorithm was used for segmentation of gray
	and white matter. The group difference in ADC values was assessed
	with independent-sample t tests. Pearson correlation analysis was
	used to examine the correlation of ADC values with age and memory
	test scores. RESULTS: Higher ADCs were found in hippocampus, temporal
	lobe gray matter, and corpus callosum of patients with MCI compared
	with that of control subjects (P < .05). By pooling all subjects
	together, an elevated hippocampal ADC was significantly correlated
	with worse memory performance scores in 5-minute and 30-minute delayed
	word-list recall tasks (P < .05). CONCLUSION: ADCs from gray and
	white matter of different brain regions can be analyzed by applying
	an automated template-masking method in conjunction with a skeleton-based
	region competition segmentation algorithm.},

	The latter have generally been obtained by creating endocasts out
	of rubber latex shells filled with plaster. The extent to which the
	method of production introduces errors in endocast replicas is unknown.
	We demonstrate a powerful method of comparing complex shapes in 3-dimensions
	(3D) that is broadly applicable to a wide range of paleoanthropological
	questions. Pairs of virtual endocasts (VEs) created from high-resolution
	CT scans of corresponding latex/plaster endocasts and their associated
	crania were rigidly registered (aligned) in 3D space for two Homo
	sapiens and two Pan troglodytes specimens. Distances between each
	cranial VE and its corresponding latex/plaster VE were then mapped
	on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The results show that between 79.7\% and
	91.0\% of the voxels in the four latex/plaster VEs are within 2 mm
	of their corresponding cranial VEs surfaces. The average error is
	relatively small, and variation in the pattern of error across the
	surfaces appears to be generally random overall. However, inferior
	areas around the cranial base and the temporal poles were somewhat
	overestimated in both human and chimpanzee specimens, and the area
	overlaying Broca's area in humans was somewhat underestimated. This
	study gives an idea of the size of possible error inherent in latex/plaster
	endocasts, indicating the level of confidence we can have with studies
	relying on comparisons between them and, e.g., hominid fossil endocasts.},

	in voxel-based analysis of white matter (WM) group differences. Currently,
	it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in
	the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate
	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating
	evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an
	ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three
	normalization methods representing the current range of available
	approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy
	(FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional
	normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed
	in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between
	ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization
	with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal
	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
	features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the
	alignment of WM tracts.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel deformable registration algorithm
	for diffusion tensor MR images that enables explicit optimization
	of tensor reorientation. The optimization seeks a piecewise affine
	transformation that divides the image domain into uniform regions
	and transform each region affinely. The objective function captures
	both the image similarity and the smoothness of the transformation
	across region boundaries. The image similarity enables explicit orientation
	optimization by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary
	for warping diffusion tensor images. The objective function is formulated
	in a way that allows explicit implementation of analytic derivatives
	to drive fast and accurate optimization using the conjugate gradient
	method. By explicitly optimizing tensor reorientation, the algorithm
	is designed to take advantage of similarity measures comparing tensors
	as a whole. The optimal transformation is hierarchically refined
	in a subdivision framework. A comparison with affine registration
	for inter-subject normalization of 8 subjects shows that the proposed
	algorithm improves the alignment of several major white matter structures
	examined: the anterior thalamic radiations, the inferior fronto-occipital
	fasciculi, the corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts and the genu and
	the splenium of the corpus callosum. The alignment of white matter
