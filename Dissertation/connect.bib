	(SD), 3) logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). PNFA is characterized
	by labored speech, agrammatism in production, and/or comprehension.
	In some cases the syndrome begins with isolated deficits in speech.
	SD patients typically present with loss of word and object meaning
	and surface dyslexia. LPA patients have word-finding difficulties,
	syntactically simple but accurate language output and impaired sentence
	comprehension. The neuropsychological data demonstrated that SD patients
	show the most characteristic pattern of impairment, while PNFA and
	LPA overlap within many cognitive domains. The neuroimaging analysis
	showed left perisylvian region involvement. A comprehensive cognitive,
	neuroimaging and pathological approach is necessary to identify the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patterns of language impairment have long been used clinically
	to localize brain damage in stroke patients. The same approach might
	be useful in the differential diagnosis of progressive aphasia owing
	to neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether scores
	on 4 widely used language tasks correlate with regional gray matter
	loss in 51 patients with progressive language impairment owing to
	neurodegenerative disease. METHOD: Scores in the Boston Naming Test
	and in the "repetition" "sequential commands" and the "language fluency,"
	subtests of the Western Aphasia Battery were correlated with voxel-wise
	gray matter volumes using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Significant
	positive correlations were found between each language task and regional
	brain volumes: (1) naming and the bilateral temporal lobes; (2) sentence
	repetition and the left posterior portion of the superior temporal
	gyrus; (3) sentence comprehension and the left dorsal middle and
	inferior frontal gyri; and (4) fluency of language production and
	the left ventral middle and inferior frontal gyri. DISCUSSION: Performance
	on specific language tasks corresponds to regional anatomic damage
	in aphasia owing to neurodegenerative disorders. These language tests
	might be useful in the differential diagnosis of primary progressive
	aphasia variants that have been previously associated with damage
	to corresponding anatomic regions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel fuzzy-segmentation method for diffusion
	tensor (DT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Typical fuzzy-segmentation
	schemes, e.g., those based on fuzzy C means (FCM), incorporate Gaussian
	class models that are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters
	characterized by a mean element and a covariance matrix. Tensors
	in fiber bundles, however, inherently lie on specific manifolds in
	Riemannian spaces. Unlike FCM-based schemes, the proposed method
	represents these manifolds using nonparametric data-driven statistical
	models. The paper describes a statistically-sound (consistent) technique
	for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian DT spaces. The proposed
	method produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel
	information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework.
	Results on synthetic and real, DT and MR images, show that the proposed
	method provides information about the uncertainties in the segmentation
	decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial
	voluming, and inhomogeneity. By enhancing the nonparametric model
	to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle,
	we exploit the framework to extract the cingulum fiber bundle. Typical
	tractography methods for tract delineation, incorporating thresholds
	on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking,
	can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise.
	For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts
	with sharp changes in orientation, such as the cingulum. The results
	demonstrate that the proposed method extracts this structure significantly
	more accurately as compared to tractography.},

	Frontal, temporal and hippocampal atrophy was measured from MRI of
	10 FTD patients, 27 AD, and 27 controls. Corrected atrophy and asymmetry
	were computed (W-scores). RESULTS: FTD had mild atrophy in the hippocampus
	(average W-score=-1.3), severe in the frontal (W-score=-2.4) and
	very severe in the temporal lobes (W-score=-2.9). AD had moderate
	atrophy in the hippocampus and temporal lobes (W-score=-1.8 and -1.9,

	in contrast with AD patients (n = 15) and age-matched controls (NC)
	(n = 15). FTD and AD patients were matched on demographic measures
	and Mini Mental State Examination scores. RESULTS: Significant atrophy
	was present in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of subjects
	with FTD compared to AD (p = 0.02; effect size = 1.11) and compared
	to NC (p < 0.001; effect size = 1.86). Severe atrophy of the left
	anterior temporal region distinguished the language variant. AD patients,
	by contrast, did not differ from NC for frontal lobe volume but had
	smaller anterior temporal lobes (p = 0.03). Both dementia groups
	had medial temporal lobe atrophy of similar magnitude. A logistic
	regression model including 4 regional measures correctly classified
	100\% of subjects. CONCLUSION: FTD can be reliably differentiated
	from AD by virtue of a topographical pattern of atrophy involving

	and 10\% degraded images) and a difficult level (composed of the
	20\%, 40\% and 60\% degraded images). Brain activation was measured
	using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The baseline face matching
	task activated a wide network of regions that included bilaterally
	the occipital, temporal and parietal lobes and the right frontal
	lobe. A novel behavioral finding was that task difficulty did not
	linearly increase with image degradation. The novel brain imaging
	finding was that the FFA is modulated by task difficulty and performance
	in the task was linearly correlated to activation in FFA. In addition,
	we found that activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
	had increased activation as task difficulty increased. When adding
	the response time as a covariate, the differences in the DLPFC did
	not remain statistically significant. Increased task difficulty also
	led to a decrease in activation of visual areas in the extrastriate
	cortex. Task difficulty increased activation in the FFA to enhance
	the face processing and suppressed activation in visual extrastriate
	areas that processed low level properties of the stimuli. Task difficulty
	led to enhanced response in the FFA and suppressed response in other
	visual areas.},

	Glucose metabolism was measured using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET

	to moderate AD patients (MMSE score > or = 17). PET data were corrected
	for brain atrophy. RESULTS: In the rest condition, glucose metabolism
	was correlated with the MMSE score primarily within the posterior
	cingulate and parietal lobes. For the activation condition, additional
	correlations were within the primary and association audiovisual
	areas. Most local maxima remained significant after correcting for

	and diffusion tensor imaging measurements. Abnormalities were detected
	by a comparison with healthy control subjects. These variables were

	controls who underwent standardized clinical and neuropsychological
	evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging. INTERVENTIONS: Diffusion
	tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
	Neuroimaging analyses resulted in localized GM atrophy and reductions
	of white matter densities; the latter correlated with behavioral
	scores. RESULTS: Voxel-based morphometry analysis showed separate
	patterns of GM atrophy in the 2 groups. Diffusion tensor imaging
	showed different WM reduction patterns in patients with fvFTD and
	tvFTD. The fvFTD group showed a selective WM reduction in the superior
	longitudinal fasciculus, interconnecting the frontal and occipital
	and the temporal and parietal regions. Conversely, patients with
	tvFTD were characterized by WM reductions in the inferior longitudinal
	fasciculus, which affected the connections between anterior temporal
	and frontal regions. The WM reductions in fvFTD paralleled both behavioral
	disturbances measured by Frontal Behavioral Inventory and neuropsychological
	deficits affecting frontal functions. CONCLUSIONS: The fvFTD and
	tvFTD variants are associated not only with selective local GM reductions
	but also with significant WM damage in early disease phase. The different
	WM patterns contribute to the different clinical syndromes in FTD

	tasks to investigate the nature of the verbal and non-verbal comprehension

	impaired on both verbal and non-verbal conditions of the assessments,

	on a range of other tests requiring access to semantic memory. Further
	analyses revealed that performance was graded by concept and sound
	familiarity and, in addition, identified significant item consistency
	across the different conditions of the tasks. These results support
	the notion that the patients' deficits across all modalities were
	due to degradation within a single, central network of conceptual
	knowledge. There were also reliable differences between conditions.
	The sound-picture matching task proved to be more sensitive to semantic
	impairment than the word-picture matching equivalent, and the patients
	performed significantly better on the picture than word version of
	a semantic association test. We propose that these differences arise
	directly from the nature of the mapping between input modality and

	their diagnostic value for AD with a newly developed immunoprecipitation

	of hippocampal, entorhinal cortex (ERC), and whole brain longitudinal
	change in cognitively normal elderly controls (C), non-demented subjects
	with cognitive impairment (CI), and demented (D) subjects. METHODS:
	16 C, 6 CI, and 7 D subjects of comparable age were studied with
	{M}{R}{I} twice, at least 1 year apart. Longitudinal change in total
	brain size was measured by several methods, including computerized
	segmentation, non-linear warping, and change in the fluid/tissue
	boundaries between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain. Change in
	hippocampal volume was measured by semi-automated methods, and ERC
	volumes were manually measured. RESULTS: The annual rate of atrophy
	was greater in D versus C and D versus CI for cortical gray matter
	(cGM) (P=0.009 and 0.002), hippocampus (P=0.0001 and 0.002), and
	for the change in the fluid/tissue boundary (P=0.03 and 0.03). The
	annual rate of atrophy of ERC was greater in both CI and D versus
	C (P=0.01 and 0.0002). No significant differences between groups
	were found using non-linear warping. CONCLUSIONS: In CI, the greatest
	annual rates of atrophy were in ERC, while in D the greatest annual
	rates of atrophy were in hippocampus and cortex. Progressive ERC
	atrophy was observed with a greater degree of cognitive impairment,
	while hippocampal and cortical atrophy were only observed in demented
	subjects.},

	with ALS with and without clinically evident frontotemporal lobar
	dementia (FTLD) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). METHODS: Voxel-based
	morphometry was used to compare T1-weighted MRI images obtained from
	ten ALS patients with FTLD, ten ALS patients who were cognitively
	and behaviorally normal, and 22 control subjects. Images from patients
	and controls were spatially pre-processed using a study-specific,
	customized template and a priori images. A statistical threshold
	of p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons determined significance.
	RESULTS: A common pattern of gray matter atrophy was seen in both
	ALS and ALS/FTLD patients when compared to controls that involved
	the bilateral motor/premotor cortices, the left middle and inferior
	frontal gyri, the anterior portion of the superior frontal gyri,
	the superior temporal gyri, the temporal poles and left posterior
	thalamus. Most of the frontal regions were significantly more atrophied
	in the ALS/FTLD group than in the ALS group. No significant differences
	were found in white matter volumes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALS
	and ALS associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration exhibit
	widespread gray matter atrophy in frontotemporal regions. This finding
	supports the idea of a clinical and anatomic continuum between ALS
	and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.},

	to investigate the in vivo pathology of frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
	However, few neuroimaging studies have focused on white matter (WM)
	alterations in this disease. OBJECTIVES: To use volumetric MRI techniques
	to identify the patterns of WM atrophy in vivo in 2 clinical variants
	of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
	and semantic dementia-and to compare the patterns of WM atrophy with
	those of gray matter (GM) atrophy in these diseases. DESIGN: Structural
	MRIs were obtained from patients with FTD (n = 12) and semantic dementia
	(n = 13) and in cognitively healthy age-matched controls (n = 24).
	Regional GM and WM were classified automatically from high-resolution
	T1-, T2-, and proton density-weighted MRIs with Expectation-Maximization
	Segmentation and compared between the groups using a multivariate
	analysis of covariance model that included age and WM lesion volumes
	as covariates. RESULTS: Patients with FTD had frontal WM atrophy
	and frontal, parietal, and temporal GM atrophy compared with controls,
	who had none. Patients with semantic dementia had temporal WM and
	GM atrophy and patients with FTD had frontal GM atrophy. Adding temporal
	WM volume to temporal GM volume significantly improved the discrimination
	between semantic dementia and FTD. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
	that patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration who are in relatively
	early stages of the disease (Clinical Dementia Rating score, 1.0-1.2)
	have WM atrophy that largely parallels the pattern of GM atrophy
	typically associated with these disorders.},

	post mortem cases meeting clinical criteria for semantic dementia.
	Clinic records and diagnostic histopathology were available for all
	cases; structural neuroimaging, neuropsychology and semi-quantitative
	histopathology/immunohistochemistry data were analysed where possible.
	The pathological diagnosis in a clear majority of cases was frontotemporal
	degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions (n = 13). Eleven of these
	cases had characteristic motor neuron disease-type inclusions in
	the dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex. Ubiquitin inclusions were
	found only in the inferior olivary nucleus in the other two, one
	of which was the only case to show degeneration of motor tracts and
	also to have shown evidence of motor neuron disease during life.
	None of the patients had motor symptoms or signs at presentation.
	A family history of motor neuron disease was documented in one case.
	Pick body-positive Pick's disease appeared three times. Two cases
	had Alzheimer's disease and significant coincidental Alzheimer-type
	pathology was also found in one of the ubiquitin inclusion cases.
	One of the Alzheimer's disease patients had changes in white matter
	signal on scanning, whereas all other scans showed cerebral atrophy
	only. Semi-quantitative assessment of regional neuronal loss found
	that anterior and inferior temporal regions bore the brunt of disease
	across all histopathological subtypes, usually on the left side,

	modality of positron emission tomography (PET) in the early diagnosis
	of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical diagnosis in the early disease
	stages is difficult and treatments are emerging which rather than
	reversing structural damage are likely to slow or halt the disease
	process. While currently no routine diagnostic test confirms AD presence,
	imaging techniques are an important expanding field in biological
	neuropsychiatry. The challenge for neuroimaging methods is to achieve
	high specificity and sensitivity in early disease stages. Glucose
	metabolic PET imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has the potential
	to detect very early neocortical dysfunction before even abnormal
	neuropsychological testing is obtainable. The implications are for
	the identification of minimally symptomatic patients that could benefit
	most from treatment strategies, as well as the monitoring of treatment
	response and possible therapeutic deceleration of the disease. FDG
	PET correlates with AD neuropathology and is able to indicate disease
	progression or severity, meeting both functional neuroimaging prerequisites
	in diagnosing AD. A combination of functional neuroimaging with different
	techniques should be able to provide highest diagnostic specificity
	in diagnosing dementia. This may even lead to a new classification
	of dementias according to differences in the causative aetiology.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be difficult
	to differentiate clinically because of overlapping symptoms. Distinguishing
	the two dementias based on volumetric measurements of brain atrophy
	with MRI has been only partially successful. Whether MRI measurements
	of cortical thinning improve the differentiation between Alzheimer's
	disease and FTD is unclear. In this study, we measured cortical thickness
	using a set of automated tools (Freesurfer) to reconstruct the brain's
	cortical surface from T1-weighted structural MRI data in 22 patients
	with Alzheimer's disease, 19 patients with FTD and 23 cognitively
	normal subjects. The goals were to detect the characteristic patterns
	of cortical thinning in these two types of dementia, to test the
	relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive impairment,
	to determine if measurement of cortical thickness is better than
	that of cortical volume for differentiating between these dementias
	and normal ageing and improving the classification of Alzheimer's
	disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores alone. Compared
	to cognitively normal subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients had
	a thinner cortex primarily in bilateral, frontal, parietal, temporal
	and occipital lobes (P < 0.001), while FTD patients had a thinner
	cortex in bilateral, frontal and temporal regions and some thinning
	in inferior parietal regions and the posterior cingulate (P < 0.001).
	Compared to FTD patients, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner
	cortex (P < 0.001) in parts of bilateral parietal and precuneus regions.
	Cognitive impairment was negatively correlated with cortical thickness
	of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer's disease, while
	similar correlations were not significant in FTD. Measurement of
	cortical thickness was similar to that of cortical volume in differentiating
	between normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and FTD. Furthermore,
	cortical thickness measurements significantly improved the classification
	between Alzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores
	alone, including the Mini-Mental State Examination and a modified
	version of the Trail-Making Test. In conclusion, the characteristic
	patterns of cortical thinning in Alzheimer's disease and FTD suggest
	that cortical thickness may be a useful surrogate marker for these
	types of dementia.},

	and Richardson, who characterized the disease as a syndrome of asymmetric
	akinesis and rigidity, dystonia of the upper limb, apraxia, myoclonus
	and dementia. Atrophy of the frontal and parietal lobe, neuronal
	loss, gliosis and achromatic neurones (and nowadays astrocytic plaques)
	are the characteristic pathological features of the disease. Corticobasal
	degeneration is a rare or a rarely recognized disease and it is frequently

	corticobasal degeneration can be diagnosed in the presence of rigidity
	and one cortical symptom (apraxia, cortical sensory loss, alien hand)
	or in a patient with rigidity, dystonia and focal reflex myoclonus.
	Exclusion criteria are early dementia (as in primary degenerative
	dementias), early vertical gaze problems (as in progressive supranuclear
	palsy), resting tremor and good, sustained therapeutic response to
	levodopa (as in Parkinson's disease), severe autonomic problems (as
	in multiple system atrophy) and any pathology on imaging studies

	have not been studied quantitatively. OBJECTIVE: To compare volumetric
	measures among primary progressive aphasia (PPA), frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD) and AD; to assess association between brain atrophy
	and cognition. PATIENTS: Seventeen patients with PPA, 11 with FTD
	and 24 with probable AD were studied. METHODS: We measured total
	and regional volume quantitatively using MRI and computerized volumetry.
	Contributing factors were controlled statistically or by adopting
	brain volume ratios. We investigated the classifying power of volumetry
	and correlated regional brain volume with cognitive and language
	test scores. RESULTS: The ratio for fronto-temporo-central region
	was smaller on the left in PPA and on the right in FTD. AD and some
	PPA patients had smaller parietal lobes. The frontal ratios correctly
	classified 93\% of PPA and FTD patients, but only 50\% of the entire
	PiC and AD patients. Language-dependent examinations correlated with
	the left fronto-temporal volume. CONCLUSIONS: Brain atrophy differs
	in PPA, FTD and AD, but there is some morphological overlap between
	PiC and AD in parietal volumes. Focal brain atrophy is most consistently
	associated with language impairments.},

	hypothesis that distinct patterns of gray matter atrophy are responsible
	for unique interruptions of the naming process in {A}lzheimer's disease
	(AD) and frontotemporal dementia ({F}{T}{D}). MATERI{A}{L}{S} AND
	METHODS: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to characterize
	at the voxel level the neuroanatomic changes that occur in {A}{D}
	and {F}{T}{D} based on high-resolution T1-weighted three-dimensional
	(3D) spoiled-gradient echo images of patients (AD, n = 12; {F}{T}{D},
	n = 29) and healthy control subjects (n = 12). The cortical atrophy
	measurements were correlated with performance on behavioral measures
	of naming and related processes to identify brain regions that may
	contribute to this language function. RESULTS: Both {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D}
	have significant naming difficulty, and this difficulty in naming
	correlates with a measure of lexical retrieval in both patient groups
	as well. However, only {F}{T}{D} patients showed a correlation with
	semantic memory. Areas of cortical atrophy common to {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D}
	were found in the anterior temporal, posterolateral temporal, and
	dorsolateral prefrontal regions of the left hemisphere. Correlation
	with naming in both {A}{D} and {F}{T}{D} was seen in the left anterior
	temporal cortex, suggesting that this area may play a role in the
	lexical retrieval component of naming. We also observed several unique
	areas of cortical atrophy in temporal and frontal cortices of these
	patients. Right anterior temporal and left posterolateral temporal
	regions of atrophy correlated with naming difficulty in {F}{T}{D},
	suggesting that these areas may contribute to the semantic memory
	component of naming. Cortical areas correlating with naming that
	are not atrophic may represent regions that play an optional role
	in naming. CONCLUSION: VBM provides an important first step in analyzing
	brain-behavior relations in vivo in patients with neurodegenerative
	diseases. More refined analyses of brain morphology via high-dimensional
	normalization methods that are capable of modeling local as well
	as global variability in neuroanatomical structure promise to be
	even more informative.},

	there is a differential cortical involvement in that parietal and
	cingulate areas are early affected in the course of Alzheimer's disease,
	and neocortical senile plaques densities are strongly correlated

  abstract = {Is the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC) a single functional region,
	or can it be subdivided into distinct areas that contribute differently
	to word processing? Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation
	(TMS) to investigate anterior and posterior LIFC when the meaning
	and sound of words were being processed. Relative to no stimulation,
	TMS of the anterior LIFC selectively increased response latencies
	when participants focused on the meaning of simultaneously presented
	words (i.e., synonym judgments) but not when they focused on the
	sound pattern of the words (i.e., homophone judgments). In contrast,
	the opposite dissociation was observed in the posterior LIFC, where
	stimulation selectively interfered with the phonological but not
	the semantic task. This double dissociation shows functionally distinct
	subdivisions of the LIFC that can be understood in terms of separable
	corticocortical connections linking the anterior LIFC to temporal
	pole regions associated with semantic memory and the posterior LIFC
	to temporoparietal regions involved in auditory speech processing.},

	PSP (n = 33) or CBD (n = 18). Patients were compared with 22 controls
	with similar age. To establish a mathematical model that would allow
	for differentiation of PSP, CBD and controls we performed a discriminant
	analysis. We found a significant reduction in average brain, brainstem,
	midbrain and frontal gray matter volumes in patients with PSP, whereas
	patients with CBD showed atrophy of parietal cortex and corpus callosum.
	With the exception of reduced midbrain volumes in PSP, the measured
	volumes of anatomical structures showed an extensive overlap with
	the normal range on an individual basis. Using only post mortem confirmed
	cases of PSP (n = 8) and CBD (n = 7) as well as all controls, the
	volumes of midbrain, parietal white matter, temporal gray matter,
	brainstem, frontal white matter and pons were identified to separate
	best between groups and were used to construct a model with two canonical
	variables. This model allowed to correctly predict the diagnosis
	in 95\% of controls as well as in 76\% of all PSP and 83\% of all
	CBD patients. Similar results were obtained only when patients with
	a possible and probable diagnosis of PSP and CBD, who were not involved
	in the development of the discriminant analysis, were classified.
	3D-MR imaging-based volumetry may help to differentiate PSP from

	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychological performance and high-resolution
	structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Distinguishing
	features of patients with tau-positive FTD include visual perceptual-spatial
	difficulty and an extrapyramidal disorder significantly more often
	than other patients, significant cortical atrophy in the frontal
	and parietal regions as evidenced on MRI, and the burden of pathology
	is greatest in the frontal and parietal regions. Patients with tau-negative
	FTD are distinguished by their greater difficulties with social,
	language, and verbally mediated executive functions, significant
	cortical atrophy in the frontal and temporal regions as evidenced
	on MRI, and significant frontal and temporal pathology. Patients
	with Alzheimer disease at autopsy have significantly impaired delayed
	recall during episodic memory testing; atrophy that involves temporal
	areas, including the hippocampus, as evidenced on MRI; and widely
	distributed pathology including the medial temporal structures. A
	discriminant function analysis grouped patients on the basis of clinical
	and neuropsychological features with 87.5\% accuracy. CONCLUSION:
	Clinical, neuropsychological, and imaging profiles can contribute
	to accurate antemortem diagnosis in FTD.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the topography and degree of
	atrophy in speech and language-associated cortical gyri in Alzheimer's
	disease. The post-mortem brains of 10 patients with pathologically
	confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 21 neurological and neuropathological
	controls were sectioned in serial 3 mm coronal slices and grey and
	white matter volumes were determined for specific cortical gyri.
	All Alzheimer's disease patients had prospectively documented impairments
	in verbal and semantic memory with concomitant global decline. The
	cortical regions of interest included the planum temporale, Heschl's
	gyri, the anterior superior temporal gyri, the middle and inferior
	temporal gyri, area 37 at the inferior temporoparietal junction,
	areas 40 and 39 (supramarginal and angular gyri) and Broca's frontal
	regions. Although most patients had end-stage disease, the language-associated
	cortical regions were affected to different degrees, with some regions
	free of atrophy. These included Broca's regions in the frontal lobe
	and Heschl's gyri on the superior surface of the temporal lobe. In
	contrast, the inferior temporal and temporoparietal gyri (area 37)
	were severely reduced in volume. The phonological processing regions
	in the superior temporal gyri (the planum temporale) were also atrophic
	in all Alzheimer's disease patients while the anterior superior temporal
	gyri were only atrophic in female patients. Such atrophy may underlie
	the more severe language impairments previously described in females
	with Alzheimer's disease. The present study is the first to analyse
	the volumes of language-associated gyri in post-mortem patients with
	confirmed Alzheimer's disease. The results show that atrophy is not
	global but site-specific. Atrophied gyri appear to reflect a specific
	network of language and semantic memory dissolution seen in the clinical
	features of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Females showed greater
	atrophy than males in the anterior superior temporal gyri.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the pattern of cortical degeneration associated
	with different language deficits in cases of AD. METHODS: Cases for
	detailed neuropathologic analysis (Patients 1 and 2) were selected
	because of their detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments
	of language dysfunction in AD. Patient 1 had severe phonologic impairment
	with relatively preserved semantic aspects of language. Patient 2
	had severe semantic language impairment with relatively preserved
	phonologic skills. The tissue volume of cortical regions associated
	with speech and language function was measured using standardized
	three-dimensional techniques. Neuronal areal fraction was also measured
	from histologic tissue samples. The degree of volume atrophy and
	neuronal loss was calculated in comparison to control measures (n
	= 10 men and 11 women). Measurements more than 2 SD from controls
	were considered abnormal. RESULTS: Both AD cases had significant
	degeneration of the superior temporal gyrus and area 37. Cortical
	language regions affected only in Patient 1 included the anterior
	and posterior insula and part of Broca's area. In contrast, Patient
	2 had a greater degree of degeneration in the temporal gyri and their
	white matter connections with the hippocampal/entorhinal complex.
	CONCLUSIONS: Variable patterns of neurodegeneration underlie the
	clinical differences observed in patients with AD. Disconnection
	within the temporal lobe appears associated with semantic language
	difficulties, whereas disconnection of the anterior and posterior
	language areas appears associated with phonologic and grammatical
	impairment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish survival in patients with pathologically
	confirmed frontotemporal dementia ({F}{T}{D}) and to determine whether
	clinical or pathologic subtype affects prognosis. METHODS: The authors
	reviewed the presenting clinical features of 61 patients with dementia
	and pathologically confirmed {F}{T}{D} studied in Sydney (n = 31)
	and Cambridge (n = 30) over a 10-year period. Data were available
	on time of symptom onset, diagnosis, institutionalization, and death.
	Cases were classified pathologically as tau-positive and tau-negative.
	RESULTS: Of the 61 patients with {F}{T}{D}, 26 presented with frontal
	variant (fv{F}{T}{D}), 9 with semantic dementia, 8 with progressive
	nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), 9 with associated motor neuron disease
	({F}{T}{D}-MND), and 9 with corticobasal degeneration features. There
	was no difference between the groups in age at symptom onset (overall
	mean 58.5 +/- 7.8 years), but at diagnosis the PNFA (68.3 +/- 2.7)
	group was significantly older than the fv{F}{T}{D} (59.9 +/- 7.4)
	and {F}{T}{D}-MND (57.7 +/- 7.9) groups. The median survival from
	symptom onset and from diagnosis was 6 +/- 1.1 years (95\% CI) for
	fv{F}{T}{D} and 3 +/- 0.4 years for {F}{T}{D}-MND. Survival across
	subgroups was equivalent except for the {F}{T}{D}-MND group, which
	had significantly shorter survival. Cases with tau-positive pathology
	had an older age at onset and a significantly better prognosis: median
	survival 9.0 +/- 0.9 years vs 5.0 +/- 1.1 years. CONCLUSIONS: {F}{T}{D}
	is a malignant disorder with limited life expectancy. {F}{T}{D}-MND
	has the shortest duration both before and after diagnosis. Tau-positivity
	is associated with a more slowly progressive form of {F}{T}{D}.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Until recently, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
	was considered a rare neurodegenerative disorder that was difficult
	to diagnose. The publication of consensus criteria for FTLD, however,
	prompted systematic studies. The criteria categorize FTLD into 3
	subgroups: frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and progressive
	nonfluent aphasia. OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic characteristics
	of patients in the 3 FTLD subgroups. DESIGN: We compared diagnostic
	breakdown, age at onset, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score
	at first visit, education, and neuropathological diagnoses in a large
	sample of FTLD patients from 3 different university dementia clinics,
	including 2 neurologic clinics in the United States and 1 psychiatric
	clinic in Germany. RESULTS: The frontotemporal dementia subgroup
	represented approximately half of all FTLD diagnoses. Patients diagnosed
	as having frontotemporal dementia (mean age, 57.5 years) and semantic
	dementia (mean age, 59.3 years) had an earlier age at onset than
	patients diagnosed as having progressive nonfluent aphasia (mean
	age, 63.0 years). There were significantly more men diagnosed as
	having frontotemporal dementia (63.5\%) and semantic dementia (66.7\%)
	when compared with progressive nonfluent aphasia (39.1\%) (P = .005
	for frontotemporal dementia vs progressive nonfluent aphasia and
	P = .002 for semantic dementia vs progressive nonfluent aphasia).
	Generally, the demographic features and diagnostic categories of
	the patient populations across the 3 sites were comparable. There
	were 68 deaths and 37 autopsies. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	with ubiquitin-positive tau-negative inclusions (48.5\%), dementia
	lacking distinctive histopathological features (18.2\%), and Pick
	disease (15.2\%) were the most common neuropathological diagnoses.
	CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that cohorts of patients can be
	combined using new research criteria for FTLD and demonstrate striking
	demographic differences among FTLD subgroups. The sex and age-at-onset
	differences suggest that there may be biological differences among
	FTLD subgroups. In this sample, FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	accounted for half of all neuropathological diagnoses.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between early clinical features,

	(FTLDs), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration
	(CBD). METHODS: The authors conducted pathologic reexamination with
	the most recent immunohistochemistry of all cases diagnosed with
	FTLD, PSP, and CBD between 1970 and 2004. The authors also reviewed
	the early clinical features for clinical diagnosis and application
	of published research criteria. RESULTS: Of 127 cases analyzed, 57
	had a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD, 49 PSP, and 21 CBD. Of these,
	38 were clinically reclassified as frontal variant frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD), 13 as progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), 21 as
	CBD-like, 33 as PSP-like, and 13 with frontotemporal dementia with
	coexisting motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). The authors were unable
	to classify nine cases. All cases of FTD-MND were tau-negative and
	had pathologic evidence of motor neuron degeneration. All cases classified
	as PSP-like or CBD-like had tau-positive pathology. Of the 13 cases
	with PNFA, PSP and CBD accounted for almost 70\% of the cases, while
	FTD was almost equally divided between tau-positive and tau-negative
	diseases. CONCLUSION: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, corticobasal
	degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have
	overlapping clinical features. The prediction of tau-positive pathology
	from a CBD or PSP-like presentation is good, while the frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD)-motor neuron disease syndrome almost certainly predicts
	motor neuron degeneration. Surprisingly, PSP and CBD accounted for
	most cases classified as progressive non-fluent aphasia. Frontal
	variant FTD is an unpredictable disease in terms of its biochemistry.},

	(AF) by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography. METHODS:
	Twenty-two patients with brain lesions adjacent to the AF in the
	frontotemporal regions of the dominant hemisphere were studied. The
	AF tractography was accomplished by placing initiation and termination
	sites (seed and target points) in the frontal and temporal regions,
	which were functionally identified by using functional magnetic resonance
	(fMR) imaging in conjunction with a verb generation task and magnetoencephalography
	(MEG) in conjunction with a reading task. The combination of fMR
	imaging and MEG data clearly demonstrated the hemispheric dominance
	of language functions, which was confirmed by an intracranial amobarbital
	test (Wada procedure). In all 22 patients, the authors were able
	to consistently visualize the AF by DT imaging-based tractography,
	using the functionally identified seed and target points and a fractional
	anisotropy value of 0.16. In two of 22 cases investigated, the functional
	information, including the results of AF tractography, fMR imaging,
	and MEG, was imported to a neuronavigation system and was validated
	by bipolar electric stimulation of the cortical and subcortical areas
	during awake surgery. The cortical stimulation to the gyrus that
	included the area of activation identified in fMR imaging with the
	language task evoked speech arrest, while the subcortical stimulation
	close to the AF reproducibly caused paranomia without speech arrest.
	Postoperative AF tractography showed that the distances between the
	stimulus points and the AF were within 6 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The combination
	of these techniques facilitated accurate identification of the location
	of the AF and verification of the language fibers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The status of imaging findings in the clinical diagnosis
	of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains uncertain; while they may
	be supportive of a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, they are
	not mandatory. Our aim was to assess patterns of lobar atrophy in
	a large sample of clinically defined, prospectively studied, patients
	using a magnetic resonance image (MRI) rating scale, to (1) determine
	whether imaging findings warrant a more prominent position in FTD
	diagnosis and (2) correlate the extent of lobar atrophy with clinical
	data. METHODS: We adapted a recently devised post mortem rating scale
	for FTD to rate lobar atrophy on MRI scans. The areas rated included
	the frontal cortex and both anterior and posterior temporal regions
	bilaterally. All available brain scans from all patients seen in
	the Cambridge Dementia Clinic (n = 258) diagnosed as having FTD,
	together with controls (n = 20), were used to assess the reliability
	of the method. A subset of these (n = 121) were used for clinico-anatomic
	analysis. RESULTS: The scale proved quick and reliable (intra-, inter-rater
	k = 0.80, 0.67). MRI scans were abnormal in the majority of patients
	(75\%), with focal atrophy present in 100\% of semantic dementia
	(SD) patients. By contrast, nearly half (47\%) of the patients with
	clinical behavioural variant FTD had scans within the normal range.
	Behavioural cases with normal scans generally had fewer cognitive
	deficits and milder functional impairment than those with abnormal
	scans, yet displayed a clinically indistinguishable behavioural syndrome.
	They were not, however, simply at an earlier stage of the disease.
	CONCLUSIONS: MRI findings should form part of the diagnostic criteria
	for SD; the absence of atrophy on MRI in many behavioural cases raises
	the prospect that the behavioural syndrome of FTD is not specific
	for patients with a neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by a known genetic mutation and so
	potentially can be diagnosed many years before the onset of symptoms.
	Neuropathological changes have been found in both striatum and frontal
	cortex in the pre-symptomatic stage. Disruption of cortico-striatal
	white matter fibre tracts is therefore likely to contribute to the
	first clinical signs of the disease. We analysed diffusion tensor
	MR image (DTI) data from 25 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs)
	and 20 matched controls using a multivariate support vector machine
	to identify patterns of changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). In
	addition, we performed probabilistic fibre tracking to detect changes
	in 'streamlines' connecting frontal cortex to striatum. We found
	a pattern of structural brain changes that includes putamen bilaterally
	as well as anterior parts of the corpus callosum. This pattern was
	sufficiently specific to enable us to correctly classify 82\% of
	scans as coming from a PSC or control subject. Fibre tracking revealed
	a reduction of frontal cortico-fugal streamlines reaching the body
	of the caudate in PSCs compared to controls. In the left hemispheres
	of PSCs we found a negative correlation between years to estimated
	disease onset and streamlines from frontal cortex to body of caudate.
	A large proportion of the fibres to the caudate body originate from
	the frontal eye fields, which play an important role in the control
	of voluntary saccades. This type of saccade is specifically impaired
	in PSCs and is an early clinical sign of motor abnormalities. A correlation
	analysis in 14 PSCs revealed that subjects with greater impairment
	of voluntary-guided saccades had fewer fibre tracking streamlines
	connecting the frontal cortex and caudate body. Our findings suggest
	a specific patho-physiological basis for these symptoms by indicating
	selective vulnerability of the associated white matter tracts.},

	different functionally discreet brain regions with some regions showing

	imaging can be used to investigate the regional distribution of cortical
	atrophy in AD in vivo. One marker for the disease-specific atrophy
	is the thickness of the cortical mantle across the brain, obtained
	with automated 3-D image processing. Here, we present data from 36
	subjects (17 controls and, 19 patients diagnosed as probable AD)
	investigated for cortical thickness across the entire brain. We show
	significant cortical thickness decline in AD in temporal, orbitofrontal
	and parietal regions, with the most pronounced changes occurring
	in the allocortical region of the medial temporal lobes, outlining
	the parahippocampal gyrus, and representing a loss of >1.25 millimeters
	of cortical thickness. Moreover, focal cortical areas decline with
	progression of the disease as measured by time from baseline scan
	as well as the Mini-Mental State Exam. The results demonstrate the
	ability of this method to detect changes in cortical thickness in
	AD, across the entire brain, without need of prior anatomical definitions.
	The regional distribution of changes reported here is consistent
	with independent findings on the distribution of neuropathological
	alterations in AD. Using cortical thickness, moreover, we provide
	a direct quantitative index of atrophy in the disease.},

	The FBI is a standardized behavioral questionnaire useful in the
	diagnosis and quantification of the personality and behavior disorder
	{F}{T}{D}. METHOD: Patients who had three consecutive yearly assessments
	with the FBI were selected, 12 with the behavioral variant of {F}{T}{D}
	({F}{T}{D}-bv) and 14 with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). RESULTS:
	FBI scores rose as the disease progressed in both the {F}{T}{D}-bv
	and PPA groups over the 3 years of testing. Initial mean FBI scores
	of the {F}{T}{D}-bv group were above the cutoff for {F}{T}{D} as
	established for this diagnosis with previous standardization. By
	the third year, the mean FBI score of PPA patients was also above
	the established cutoff for {F}{T}{D}. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of
	the study demonstrates that the FBI is sensitive to changes in behavior
	and personality in both variants of {F}{T}{D}. The FBI can be used
	to describe the evolution of symptoms and the course of the illness
	of Pick complex patients who present initially with {F}{T}{D}-bv

	as corticodentatonigral degeneration with neuronal achromasia in
	1967. After Gibb et al described 7 cases including 4 cases from the
	literature under the term of corticobasal degeneration, CBD has become
	widely recognized. The disease starts mainly in one's fifties and
	sixties with the duration of 6 to 7 years. The clinical features
	include asymmetric parkinsonism, cerebral cortical signs, and others.
	Typically, patients present with unilateral clumsiness with akinetic-rigid
	syndrome and limb-kinetic apraxia. Postural instability, gait disturbance
	and involuntary movements such as dystonia are not uncommon. The
	parkinsonism is DOPA-resistant. BEsides apraxia, alien limb syndrome,
	cortical sensory disturbances, frontal lobe-release signs, and dementia
	are representative cortical signs. Other clinical features include
	dysarthria, pyramidal tract signs and supranuclear gaze palsy. MRI,
	SPECT or PET reveals asymmetric atrophy, decrease in blood flow or
	reduction in metabolism of the frontal parietal region around the
	central sulcus. Electrophysiological and magnetic stimulation studies
	demonstrated increase in excitability of the cerebral cortex. Myoclonus
	in CBD is cortical in origin but without any preceding potential
	or giant somatosensory evoked potential. Neuropathologically CBD
	is characterized by involvement of the particular cortices and substantia
	nigra. Other structures such as the putamen, pallidum, thalamus,
	subthalamus, cerebellar dentate nucleus and brainstem are affected
	to various extents. Histological features include achromatic, ballooned
	neurons as well as tau and Gallyas positive neuronal and glial intracytoplasmic
	inclusions. Astrocytic plaque is considered to be a form of glial
	inclusions specific to CBD. Diagnosis of typical cases of CBD appears
	easy but atypical cases were reported with showed dementia or aphasia
	as a main feature, or were devoid of the asymmetry of signs and symptoms.
	CBD, progressive supranuclear palsy and Pick's disease share both
	clinical and neuropathological features to some extent while they
	are clearly distinct among typical cases. The etiology and pathomechanism
	of CBD remain to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {The speed of progression of Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary
	changes is unknown. One reason for this is the impossibility to histopathologically
	follow-up one and the same individual over decades of their life.
	The present approach takes advantage of a recently introduced classification
	system which allows for a ranking of Alzheimer's disease-related
	neurofibrillary changes into six stages [Braak and Braak Acta Neuropath
	(1991) 82, 239-259] and analyses a staged sample of 887 brains obtained
	from routine autopsy. It sets out to interpret these cross-sectional
	data in dynamic longitudinal terms, in order to estimate the rate
	of passing through the various stages. The time needed to attain
	respective stages of pathology for 5\% of a given cumulative sample
	is determined. The resulting fifth centiles are a measure of the
	average rate by which the disease-related changes progress assuming
	that the underlying stages represent a sequence of events and do
	not independently emerge. Advancing age and the prevalence of Alzheimer's
	disease-related changes of a given stage show a nonlinear positive
	correlation with only slight acceleration above the age of 65 years.
	Statistically, it takes at least 16 years from stage I to stage II,
	about 14 years pass by from stage II to III, 13 years from stage
	III to IV and five years from stage IV to V (= Alzheimer's disease)
	for 5\% of a given cumulative sample. Thus, the deep roots of Alzheimer's
	disease-related neurofibrillary changes can be traced about 50 years
	back and may even extend into adolescence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

	the orientation of the principal direction of diffusion defined for
	each image voxel. Running the streamline process repeatedly using
	Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates
	maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting
	the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion
	tensor in terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two candidates
	for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed
	and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions
	are generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The methods
	presented provide a generic framework for utilizing streamline methods

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second commonest degenerative
	cause of dementia under the age of 65, often presents with striking
	changes in behaviour and personality in association with frontal
	lobe atrophy. Based on the behavioural changes observed in FTD, it
	is commonly assumed that the orbitofrontal cortex is the earliest
	and most severely affected frontal sub-region. However, evidence
	to support this assumption has to date been largely lacking. METHODS:
	Using a novel volumetric MRI method, we performed a detailed volumetric
	analysis of six frontal regions in 12 subjects with the frontal or
	behavioural variant of FTD (fvFTD) and 12 age-, education- and sex-matched
	normal controls. The regions studied were: the orbitofrontal and
	insula regions (representing the orbitobasal cortex); the inferior
	and middle frontal regions (representing the dorsolateral prefrontal
	areas); and the superior frontal and anterior cingulate regions (representing
	the medial prefrontal areas). RESULTS: As a group, the fvFTD patients
	showed atrophy involving all six regions. We then segregated the
	12 patients into three sub-groups according to their overall degree
	of atrophy. In the mildest group (n = 3) all regions fell within
	2 standard deviations of normal. In the intermediate group (n = 6)
	only the orbitofrontal region (bilaterally) fell clearly outside
	the control range (>2 z scores below the control mean); the next
	most atrophic region in this group was the right insular region.
	The severe group (n = 3) had generalized atrophy throughout the frontal
	regions measured. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patients with the earliest
	stages of fvFTD show no significant loss of volume in any frontal
	lobe area as measured by a novel MRI volumetric technique. When volume
	loss does occur, changes are initially seen in the orbitofrontal
	cortex before atrophy becomes more widespread. These results provide
	some partial support for the often-quoted assumption that the orbitofrontal
	cortex is the locus of earliest pathology in fvFTD, although these
	findings must be regarded as preliminary in view of the small numbers
	of patients involved.},

  abstract = {This article illustrates how functional neuroimaging can be used to
	test the validity of neurological and cognitive models of language.
	Three models of language are described: the 19th Century neurological
	model which describes both the anatomy and cognitive components of
	auditory and visual word processing, and 2 20th Century cognitive
	models that are not constrained by anatomy but emphasise 2 different
	routes to reading that are not present in the neurological model.
	A series of functional imaging studies are then presented which show
	that, as predicted by the 19th Century neurologists, auditory and
	visual word repetition engage the left posterior superior temporal
	and posterior inferior frontal cortices. More specifically, the roles
	Wernicke and Broca assigned to these regions lie respectively in
	the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the anterior insula. In
	addition, a region in the left posterior inferior temporal cortex
	is activated for word retrieval, thereby providing a second route
	to reading, as predicted by the 20th Century cognitive models. This
	region and its function may have been missed by the 19th Century
	neurologists because selective damage is rare. The angular gyrus,
	previously linked to the visual word form system, is shown to be
	part of a distributed semantic system that can be accessed by objects
	and faces as well as speech. Other components of the semantic system
	include several regions in the inferior and middle temporal lobes.
	From these functional imaging results, a new anatomically constrained
	model of word processing is proposed which reconciles the anatomical
	ambitions of the 19th Century neurologists and the cognitive finesse
	of the 20th Century cognitive models. The review focuses on single
	word processing and does not attempt to discuss how words are combined
	to generate sentences or how several languages are learned and interchanged.
	Progress in unravelling these and other related issues will depend
	on the integration of behavioural, computational and neurophysiological
	approaches, including neuroimaging.},

	with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer disease (AD). RESULTS:
	SEMD was associated with significantly more socioemotional behavioral
	dysfunction than the other two variants of PPA and than AD, specifically
	more disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, and eating disorders-behaviors
	that are typical of FTD. In contrast, PNFA and LPA did not differ
	from each other or from AD in the type or severity of behavioral
	dysfunction. Behavioral abnormalities increased in severity with
	disease duration in SEMD, but this association was not detected in
	PNFA or LPA. CONCLUSIONS: Semantic dementia is associated with significantly
	more behavioral dysfunction than other variants of primary progressive
	aphasia, specifically behavioral features typical of frontotemporal
	dementia.},

	associated with two clinical variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	(FTLD): frontotemporal dementia ({F}{T}{D}) and semantic dementia
	(SemD). METHODS: Twenty patients with FTLD were classified as having
	{F}{T}{D} (N = 8) or SemD (N = 12) based on current clinical criteria.
	Both groups showed a similar spectrum of behavioral abnormalities,
	as indicated by the neuropsychiatric inventory. T1-weighted {M}{R}{I}
	was obtained for each patient and 20 control subjects. The regions
	of focal gray matter tissue loss associated with both {F}{T}{D} and
	SemD, as well as those differing between the two groups were examined
	using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Regions of significant atrophy
	seen in both groups were located in the ventromedial frontal cortex,
	the posterior orbital frontal regions bilaterally, the insula bilaterally,
	and the left anterior cingulate cortex. The {F}{T}{D}, but not the
	SemD, group showed atrophy in the right dorsolateral frontal cortex
	and the left premotor cortex. The SemD, but not the {F}{T}{D}, group
	showed tissue loss in the anterior temporal cortex and the amygdala/anterior
	hippocampal region bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: Although {F}{T}{D} and
	SemD are associated with different overall patterns of brain atrophy,
	regions of gray matter tissue loss in the orbital frontal, insular,
	and anterior cingulate regions are present in both groups. The authors
	suggest that pathology in the areas of atrophy associated with both
	{F}{T}{D} and SemD may underlie some the behavioral symptoms seen
	in the two disorders.},

	The cytopathology of neurons in the dorsomedial quadrant and of large

	Nine of the 11 centers tested met the reliability criteria of the
	phantom test. Across all centers, a bias was found in the measurements
	of slice thickness and length. For voxel-based morphometry, the coefficient
	of variation yielded 5.02\% for gray matter volume and 12.81\% (SD
	9.06\%) for gray matter signal intensity in voxels. Power analysis
	showed that a sample size of 150 subjects is sufficient for statistically
	valid detection of reduced gray matter volume in patients with mild

	of cholinergic neurones in the nucleus basalis Meynert, located within
	the substantia innominata at the ventral surface of the basal forebrain.
	An in vivo measure of morphological changes in the nucleus basalis
	Meynert would be of high relevance to better understand the structural
	correlate of cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. In this
	study, we applied a newly developed automated technique of image
	regression analysis, implemented through code written in Matlab 5.3
	(MathWorks, Natick, MA), to the analysis of proton density weighted
	structural MRI of the basal forebrain from 13 patients with Alzheimer's
	disease (mean age = 77.5 years, SD = 4.4 years, 8 women) and 12 healthy
	elderly subjects (mean age = 62.3 years, SD = 5.6 years, 6 women).
	This technique allows searching a large portion of the substantia
	innominata for signal changes. We used corresponding MRI and histological
	sections of a post mortem brain to map the locations of basal forebrain
	cholinergic nuclei into the MRI standard space. Additionally, we
	used voxel-based morphometry, implemented in SPM2 (Wellcome Department
	of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) to determine correlations between
	signal changes in the substantia innominata and cortical grey matter
	atrophy in the patients with Alzheimer's disease. When matching the
	locations of signal reductions in the in vivo MRI to the template
	of basal nuclei based on the postmortem brain, signal intensity was
	decreased in areas corresponding to anterior lateral and anterior
	medial nucleus basalis Meynert and increased in the third ventricle,
	the transverse fissure and the optic tract in patients with Alzheimer's
	disease compared with controls. The reduction of the signal intensity
	in an area corresponding to the anterior lateral nucleus basalis
	Meynert was significantly correlated with reduced grey matter concentration
	in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule and
	cingulate gyrus. Our findings suggest that signal changes occur in
	patients with Alzheimer's disease in the substantia innominata which
	may be related to the loss or degeneration of cholinergic neurones
	and correspond to regional cortical grey matter atrophy. If replicated
	in an independent sample, our technique may be useful to detect degeneration
	of basal forebrain cholinergic neurones in vivo.},

  abstract = {We detected and mapped a dynamically spreading wave of gray matter
	loss in the brains of patients with {A}lzheimer's disease (AD). The
	loss pattern was visualized in four dimensions as it spread over
	time from temporal and limbic cortices into frontal and occipital
	brain regions, sparing sensorimotor cortices. The shifting deficits
	were asymmetric (left hemisphere > right hemisphere) and correlated
	with progressively declining cognitive status (p < 0.0006). Novel
	brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of
	atrophy in 52 high-resolution magnetic resonance image scans of 12
	patients with {A}{D} (age 68.4 +/- 1.9 years) and 14 elderly matched
	controls (age 71.4 +/- 0.9 years) scanned longitudinally (two scans;
	interscan interval 2.1 +/- 0.4 years). A cortical pattern matching
	technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution
	across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined
	sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary
	tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing
	deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal
	regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later
	(>15\% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of {A}{D} and
	differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates
	(5.3 +/- 2.3\% per year in {A}{D} v 0.9 +/- 0.9\% per year in controls)
	were faster in the left hemisphere (p < 0.029) than the right. Transient
	barriers to disease progression appeared at limbic/frontal boundaries.
	This degenerative sequence, observed in vivo as it developed, provides
	the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic
	rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.},

	disorders caused by progressive anterior horn cell degeneration and

	chronic autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy in a large,

	had some of the same clinical features as spinal muscular atrophy
	with respiratory distress, we tested the disease gene for linkage

	in the genetic interval that included the spinal muscular atrophy
	with respiratory distress gene (D11S1889-D11S1321, Z(max) = 4.59
	at theta = 0 at locus D11S4136). The sequencing of IGHMBP2, the human
	homologue of the mouse neuromuscular degeneration gene (nmd) that
	accounts for spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, failed
	to detect any mutation in our chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy
	patients, suggesting that spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory
	distress and chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy are caused by
	distinct genes located in the same chromosomal region. In addition,
	the high intrafamilial variability in age at onset raises the question
	of whether nonallelic modifying genes could be involved in chronic
	distal spinal muscular atrophy.},

	Although clinical criteria have been defined for both diseases, there

	magnetic resonance imaging to better characterize these diseases

	unbiased in that it looks throughout the whole brain and does not
	require any a priori assumptions concerning which structures to assess,
	giving it a significant advantage over traditional region of interest-based
	methods. Voxel-based morphometry has been widely used to assess patterns
	of regional atrophy in subjects with AD and FTLD. These studies have
	demonstrated specific patterns of regional loss in both diseases,
	compared the 2 diseases to look for differences that could be diagnostically

  abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders are pathologically characterized by the
	deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain. It is likely that future
	treatment trials will target the underlying protein biochemistry
	and it is therefore increasingly important to be able to distinguish
	between different pathologies during life. The aim of this study
	was to determine whether rates of brain atrophy differ in neurodegenerative
	dementias that vary by pathological diagnoses and characteristic
	protein biochemistry. Fifty-six autopsied subjects were identified
	with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and two serial head MRI. Subjects
	were subdivided based on pathological diagnoses into Alzheimer's
	disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB,
	frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive
	changes (FTLD-U), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive
	supranuclear palsy (PSP). Twenty-five controls were matched by age,
	gender and scan interval, to the study cohort. The boundary-shift
	integral was used to calculate change over time in whole brain (BBSI)
	and ventricular volume (VBSI). All BSI results were annualized by
	adjusting for scan interval. The rates of whole brain atrophy and
	ventricular expansion were significantly increased compared to controls
	in the Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB, FTLD-U,
	CBD and PSP groups. However, atrophy rates in the DLB group were
	not significantly different from control rates of atrophy. The largest
	rates of atrophy were observed in the CBD group which had a BBSI
	of 2.3\% and VBSI of 16.2\%. The CBD group had significantly greater
	rates of BBSI and VBSI than the DLB, mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB,
	Alzheimer's disease and PSP groups, with a similar trend observed
	when compared to the FTLD-U group. The FTLD-U group showed the next
	largest rates with a BBSI of 1.7\% and VBSI of 9.6\% which were both
	significantly greater than the DLB group. There was no significant
	difference in the rates of atrophy between the Alzheimer's disease,
	mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and PSP groups, which all showed similar
	rates of atrophy; BBSI of 1.1, 1.3 and 1.0\% and VBSI of 8.3, 7.2
	and 10.9\%, respectively. Rates of atrophy therefore differ according
	to the pathological diagnoses and underlying protein biochemistry.
	While rates are unlikely to be useful in differentiating Alzheimer's
	disease from cases with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB pathology,
	they demonstrate important pathophysiological differences between
	DLB and those with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and Alzheimer's
	disease pathology, and between those with CBD and PSP pathology.},

	different pathologic substrates of FTD have distinct patterns of
	regional atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DESIGN: Retrospective
	case study. SETTING: The Institute of Neurology, University College
	London, and the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London.Patients
	Twenty-one cases of FTD selected on pathologic grounds (9 with ubiquitin-positive
	[tau- and alpha-synuclein-negative] inclusions [FTD-U], 7 with Pick
	disease [PiD], and 5 with familial FTD with tau exon 10+16 mutations
	[tau exon 10+16]) and 20 healthy controls were studied. MAIN OUTCOME
	MEASURES: Patterns of gray matter atrophy in each group as assessed
	by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and a blinded visual assessment
	of each MRI study. RESULTS: All pathologic substrates were associated
	with atrophy that involved the inferior and medial temporal and inferior
	frontal lobes. Additionally, specific VBM signatures were identified
	for each subgroup: FTD-U was associated with asymmetric (left > right)
	temporal lobe atrophy, PiD was associated with severe dorsolateral
	bifrontal atrophy, and tau exon 10+16 was associated with asymmetric
	(right > left) medial temporal lobe atrophy. The VBM findings were
	supported by blinded visual assessment. CONCLUSION: These findings
	suggest that MRI patterns of regional gray matter atrophy constitute
	signatures of tissue pathology in FTD.},

	(FTD) has never been systematically studied using diffusion-weighted
	imaging (DWI). We studied FTD patients using DWI to determine whether
	microstructural changes in white matter can be detected in vivo.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen FTD patients and 15 aged healthy
	subjects were studied. Mean diffusivity (MD) abnormalities in 28
	white matter regions were visually evaluated. In addition, MD values
	in 10 white matter regions relative to that in the ipsilateral postcentral
	gyrus were measured. The results were compared between healthy subjects
	and FTD patients. RESULTS: The visual rating resulted in a significant
	MD elevation in FTD patients in the bilateral high superior frontal
	gyri, right orbitofrontal gyrus, bilateral anterior temporal lobes,
	and left middle temporal lobe (P < .01, respectively). Relative MD
	comparison revealed a significant MD elevation in FTD patients in
	the bilateral high superior frontal gyri, bilateral orbitofrontal
	gyri, and bilateral anterior temporal lobes (P < .05 after Bonferroni
	correction, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated white
	matter MD abnormalities in FTD patients. It was suggested that the
	observed white matter MD abnormalities are secondary to damage in
	the overlying cortex.},

	optimization by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary
	for warping diffusion tensor images. The objective function is formulated
	in a way that allows explicit implementation of analytic derivatives
	to drive fast and accurate optimization using the conjugate gradient
	method. By explicitly optimizing tensor reorientation, the algorithm
	is designed to take advantage of similarity measures comparing tensors
	as a whole. The optimal transformation is hierarchically refined
	in a subdivision framework. A comparison with affine registration
	for inter-subject normalization of 8 subjects shows that the proposed
	algorithm improves the alignment of several major white matter structures
	examined: the anterior thalamic radiations, the inferior fronto-occipital
	fasciculi, the corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts and the genu and
	the splenium of the corpus callosum. The alignment of white matter
	structures is assessed using a novel scheme of computing distances
	between the corresponding fiber bundles derived from tractography.},

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},
