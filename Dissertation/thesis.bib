	scale, gray matter volume and FA were negatively correlated, whereas
	MD was positively correlated with age. Voxel-wise analyses showed
	brain volume and FA were negatively correlated predominantly in anterior
	structures, whereas MD was positively correlated in the cortical
	gray matter and periventricular white matter. Volume preservation
	was observed in the cingulate gyrus and subjacent white matter. FA
	increase was observed in the putamen. Voxel-based direct comparisons
	of volume and diffusion properties showed FA was more strongly negatively
	correlated in the fronto-temporal white matter, compared with volume
	and MD. Stronger positive correlation of MD was observed in the thalamus,
	caudate nucleus, and midbrain and stronger negative correlation of
	brain volume was observed in the frontal lobe and basal ganglia,
	compared with the other. These results indicate that diffusion properties
	and brain volume are complementary markers to the effects of aging.},

	SETTING: Community-based research and training center. PARTICIPANTS:
	Persons (N=188) who had sustained TBI within 4 years of enrollment
	into the project were interviewed at either 2 and 3 assessments.
	Each assessment was approximately 1 year apart. Several Axis I diagnoses
	were analyzed to detect cross-sectional differences (by age and time
	postinjury) and average individual changes over the multiple measurement
	time points. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
	Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical
	Manual of Mental Disorders. RESULTS: The odds ratios changed longitudinally
	within each subject, indicating a decreased probability of having
	an Axis I diagnosis over time. There were few cross-sectional differences
	in age; therefore, age at the time of injury had little impact on
	Axis I diagnoses. Cross-sectional time since injury was not associated
	with more psychiatric disorders, whereas cross-sectional preinjury
	history of psychiatric disorders was predictive of postinjury psychiatric
	disorders. After controlling for cross-sectional effects, the frequencies
	of Axis I disorders increased in depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic

	magnetic resonance images provide unique and complementary tools
	for quantifying the living brain. We leverage both modalities in
	a diffeomorphic normalization method that unifies analysis of clinical
	datasets in a consistent and inherently multivariate (MV) statistical
	framework. We use this technique to study MV effects of traumatic
	brain injury (TBI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We contrast T1 and DT
	image-based measurements in the thalamus and hippocampus of 12 TBI
	survivors and nine matched controls normalized to a combined DT and
	T1 template space. The normalization method uses maps that are topology-preserving
	and unbiased. Normalization is based on the full tensor of information
	at each voxel and, simultaneously, the similarity between high-resolution
	features derived from T1 data. The technique is termed symmetric
	normalization for MV neuroanatomy (SyNMN). Voxel-wise MV statistics
	on the local volume and mean diffusion are assessed with Hotelling's
	T(2) test with correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: TBI
	significantly (false discovery rate P < .05) reduces volume and increases
	mean diffusion at coincident locations in the mediodorsal thalamus
	and anterior hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: SyNMN reveals evidence that
	TBI compromises the limbic system. This TBI morphometry study and
	an additional performance evaluation contrasting SyNMN with other
	methods suggest that the DT component may aid normalization quality.},

  abstract = {A hypothetical model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a uniquely human
	brain disorder rooted in its exceptional process of myelination is
	presented. Cortical regions with the most protracted development
	are most vulnerable to AD pathology, and this protracted development
	is driven by oligodendrocytes, which continue to differentiate into
	myelin producing cells late into the fifth decade of life. The unique
	metabolic demands of producing and maintaining their vast myelin
	sheaths and synthesizing the brain's cholesterol supply make oligodendrocytes
	especially susceptible to a variety of insults. Their vulnerability
	increases with increasing age at differentiation as later-differentiating
	cells myelinate increasing numbers of axonal segments. These vulnerable
	late-differentiating cells drive the protracted process of intracortical
	myelination and by increasing local cholesterol and iron levels,
	progressively increase the toxicity of the intracortical environment
	forming the basis for the age risk factor for AD. At older ages,
	the roughly bilaterally symmetrical continuum of oligodendrocyte
	vulnerability manifests as a progressive pattern of myelin breakdown
	that recapitulates the developmental process of myelination in reverse.
	The ensuing homeostatic responses to myelin breakdown further increase
	intracortical toxicity and results in the relentless progression
	and non-random anatomical distribution of AD lesions that eventually
	cause neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. This process causes
	a slowly progressive disruption of neural impulse transmission that
	degrades the temporal synchrony of widely distributed neural networks
	underlying normal brain function. The resulting network "disconnections"
	first impact functions that are most dependent on large-scale synchronization
	including higher cognitive functions and formation of new memories.
	Multiple genetic and environmental risk factors (e.g. amyloid beta-peptide
	and free radical toxicity, head trauma, anoxia, cholesterol levels,
	etc.) can contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in aging
	and AD through their impact on the life-long trajectory of myelin
	development and breakdown. This development-to-degeneration model
	is testable through imaging and post mortem methods and highlights
	the vital role of myelin in impulse transmission and synchronous
	brain function. The model offers a framework that explains the anatomical
	distribution and progressive course of AD pathology, some of the
	failures of promising therapeutic interventions, and suggests further
	testable hypotheses as well as novel approaches for intervention

	Magnetoencephalographic data were acquired from 22 subjects, half
	of whom performed a finger-tapping task, whereas the other half were
	studied at rest. We found that brain functional networks were characterized
	by small-world properties at all six wavelet scales considered, corresponding
	approximately to classical delta (low and high), , alpha, beta, and
	gamma frequency bands. Global topological parameters (path length,
	clustering) were conserved across scales, most consistently in the
	frequency range 2-37 Hz, implying a scale-invariant or fractal small-world
	organization. Dynamical analysis showed that networks were located
	close to the threshold of order/disorder transition in all frequency
	bands. The highest-frequency gamma network had greater synchronizability,
	greater clustering of connections, and shorter path length than networks
	in the scaling regime of (lower) frequencies. Behavioral state did
	not strongly influence global topology or synchronizability; however,
	motor task performance was associated with emergence of long-range
	connections in both beta and gamma networks. Long-range connectivity,
	e.g., between frontal and parietal cortex, at high frequencies during
	a motor task may facilitate sensorimotor binding. Human brain functional
	networks demonstrate a fractal small-world architecture that supports

	with the "frontal ageing" hypothesis, there was a significant positive
	correlation between mean diffusivity (D) and age, and a significant
	negative correlation between fractional anisotropy (FA) and age in
	corpus callosum genu; correlations not seen in splenium. Significant
	positive correlations were also observed between D and age in bilateral
	cingulum cingulate gyri, uncinate fasciculi and right corticospinal
	tract. This pattern of correlations was not, however, reproduced
	when those subjects with significant white matter lesion load were
	analyzed separately from those without. These data therefore suggest
	that brain atrophy and white matter lesions play a significant role

	resonance (MR) imaging to track fibers combined with cortical stimulation
	mapping to delineate descending motor pathways. Subcortical localization
	of motor pathways in relation to a glioma may provide critical information
	to guide tumor resection and prevent surgical morbidity. METHODS:
	Eleven adult patients harboring gliomas underwent MR imaging 1 day
	prior to image-guided intraoperative cortical motor mapping and tumor
	resection. Screens depicting 27 cortical motor sites on a surgical
	navigation system were saved to launch DT imaging of fiber tracks
	of descending motor pathways. The position and organization of motor
	tracts were visualized by fiber tracking. Tracks from 16 motor stimulation
	sites followed descending pathways from the precentral gyrus, through
	the corona radiata and internal capsule, and into the cerebral peduncle.
	These tracks were also observed on DT images to diverge along crossing
	white matter bundles (four patients) and to terminate or deviate
	in regions of peritumoral vasogenic edema (five patients). CONCLUSIONS:
	The use of precise intraoperative cortical mapping information and
	DT images of fiber tracks can reveal the course of motor pathways
	beneath the cortex. The subcortical fiber tracks generated are consistent
	with the known anatomical course and somatotopic organization of
	the motor tract in relation to its cortical origins. Tracking fibers
	by using DT imaging in combination with functional localization has
	the potential to reduce surgical morbidity by revealing subcortical
	connections of the functional cortex.},

	Several studies take the position that the corpus callosum provides

	This review examines these two contrasting theories of interhemispheric

	(WMHI) with cognitive performance, cerebral structure, and cerebral
	metabolism in 51 healthy individuals aged 19 to 91 years without
	cerebrovascular risk factors. BACKGROUND: Abnormal white matter signals
	have been associated with brain atrophy, reduced cerebral blood flow,
	focal neurologic signs, gait disorder, and poorer neuropsychological
	test performance. Most studies of WMHI, however, include subjects
	with hypertension or other identifiable causes of cerebrovascular
	disease that may have an independent effect on brain structure and
	function. To assess brain changes associated with WMHI independent
	of cerebrovascular risk factors, we determined WMHI volume, brain
	volume, cerebral metabolism, and cognitive performance for a group
	of subjects free of medical illness. Regional cerebral metabolism
	and cognitive domains were also assessed to evaluate the possible
	role of frontal lobe dysfunction in subjects with WMHI. DESIGN: Cross-sectional
	study of 51 very healthy subjects aged 19 to 91 years. METHODS: WMHI,
	brain, and CSF volumes were determined by MRI segmentation. Neuropsychological
	tests were employed to assess multiple cognitive domains. Brain metabolism
	was determined from 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET. Multivariate
	relations were tested with stepwise linear regression. Models included
	the potential confounders of age and education where appropriate.
	RESULTS: The distribution of WMHI volume was bimodal, with five subjects
	having WMHI volumes beyond three SDs from the normally distributed
	population. A WMHI volume of greater than 0.5\% of intracranial volume
	was considered abnormal. Within the multivariate models, WMHI volumes
	were significantly predictive of increased ventricular volume, reduced
	brain volume, and reduced cognitive scores. Subjects with greater
	than 0.5\% WMHI volume also had significantly lower frontal lobe
	metabolism, significantly higher systolic blood pressure, significantly
	larger ventricular volume, and significantly lower scores on frontal
	lobe-mediated neuropsychological tests than age-matched controls.
	CONCLUSION: WMHI volume is associated with structural and functional
	brain changes even within a group of very healthy individuals. WMHI
	is associated with poorer frontal lobe cognitive function and, when
	severe, is accompanied by significantly reduced frontal lobe metabolism.
	Subjects with large WMHI volumes have significantly higher systolic
	blood pressure, brain atrophy, reduced cerebral metabolism, and lower
	scores on tests of frontal lobe function than age-matched controls.
	Large amounts of WMHI are, therefore, pathologic and may be related
	to elevated systolic blood pressure even when it is within the normal
	age-related range.},

	alexia. To assess the reliability of the DTI-FT measurements, occipital-callosal
	projections were estimated from each subject's left and right hemispheres
	independently. The left and right estimates converged onto the same
	positions within the splenium. We further characterized the properties
	of the estimated occipital-callosal fiber tracts by combining them
	with functional MRI. We used functional MRI to identify visual field
	maps in cortex and labeled fibers by the cortical functional response
	at the fiber endpoint. This labeling reveals a regular organization

	projections through the inferior-anterior corner of the splenium.
	The agreement between the independent left/right estimates, further

	validates the DTI-FT methods. However, a principal limitation of
	these methods is low sensitivity: a large number of fiber tracts

	in 226 participants of the PROGRESS study. WMH severity was assessed
	using a visual rating scale. During follow-up, patients were classified
	for incident severe cognitive deterioration (including dementia)
	using standard criteria. RESULTS: Over 4-year follow-up, the incidence
	of severe cognitive deterioration ranged from 1.1 to 9.1 per 100
	person-years in patients with respectively no or severe WMHs at baseline.
	In multivariable analysis, incident severe cognitive deterioration
	was associated with baseline severe WMHs (odds ratio=7.7, P<0.005).
	CONCLUSIONS: Higher WMH load is a strong predictor of dementia and
	cognitive decline in patients with cerebrovascular disease history.},

	properties in the age range of 40 to 60 years. 100 participants were
	scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each hemisphere was

	age and the regional measures of FA and WM volume were tested, and
	then FA and WM volume were correlated, corrected for intracranial
	volume, age, and sex. WM volume was weakly related to age, while
	FA correlated negatively with age in 26 of 70 regions, caused by
	a mix of reduced axial and increased radial diffusion with age. 23
	relationships between FA and WM volume were found, with seven being
	positive and sixteen negative. The positive correlations were mainly
	caused by increased radial diffusion. It is concluded that FA is
	more sensitive than volume to changes in WM integrity during middle
	age, and that FA-age correlations probably are related to reduced
	amount of myelin with increasing age. Further, FA and WM volume are
	moderately to weakly related and to a large extent sensitive to different

	paired control-state image from the task-state image, thereby removing
	areas not recruited by the task. When imaged in isolation the centre
	of an activated area can be located very precisely. This allows subtle
	shifts in response locale due to changes in task to be detected readily
	despite poor spatial resolution. As an initial application of this
	strategy we mapped the retinal projection topography of human primary
	visual cortex. Functional zones separated by less than 3 mm (centre-to-centre)
	were differentiated using PET CBF images with a spatial resolution
	of 18 mm. This technique is not limited to a particular brain area
	or type of behaviour but does require that the increase in CBF produced

  abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear
	input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to
	the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the
	implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters
	that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2)
	parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and
	(3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that
	coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known,
	deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We
	developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity
	using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this
	context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity
	and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced
	by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI
	experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration
	among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time
	or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations
	or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of
	effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes
	in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike
	previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses
	to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as

	used to investigate the development of white matter (WM). However,
	information about this development in healthy children younger than
	2 years of age is lacking, and most previous studies have only measured
	fractional anisotropy (FA). This study used FA and radial and axonal
	diffusivities in children younger than 2 years of age, aiming to
	determine the temporal and spatial development of axonal maturation
	and myelination of WM in healthy children. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
	A total of 60 healthy pediatric subjects were imaged by using a 3T
	MR imaging scanner. They were divided into 3 groups: 20 at 3 weeks,
	20 at 1 year of age, and 20 at 2 years of age. All subjects were
	imaged asleep without sedation. FA and axial and radial diffusivities
	were obtained. Eight regions of interest were defined, including
	both central and peripheral WM for measuring diffusion parameters.
	RESULTS: A significant elevation in FA (P < .0001) and a reduction
	in axial and radial diffusivities (P < .0001) were observed from
	22 days to 1 year of age, whereas only radial diffusivity showed
	significant changes (P = .0014) from 1 to 2 years of age. The region-of-interest
	analysis revealed that FA alone may not depict the underlying biologic
	underpinnings of WM development, whereas directional diffusivities
	provide more insights into the development of WM. Finally, the spatial
	development of WM begins from the central to the peripheral WM and
	from the occipital to the frontal lobes. CONCLUSIONS: With both FA
	and directional diffusivities, our results demonstrate the temporal
	and spatial development of WM in healthy children younger than 2
	years of age.},

	were studied. By using models of the cortical surface and sulcal
	landmarks and a statistical model for gray matter density, human
	cortical development could be visualized across the age range in
	a spatiotemporally detailed time-lapse sequence. The resulting time-lapse
	"movies" reveal that (i) higher-order association cortices mature
	only after lower-order somatosensory and visual cortices, the functions
	of which they integrate, are developed, and (ii) phylogenetically
	older brain areas mature earlier than newer ones. Direct comparison
	with normal cortical development may help understanding of some neurodevelopmental
	disorders such as childhood-onset schizophrenia or autism.},

	cortex (vACC), consistently show greater activity during resting

	that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode
	of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions
	pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network
	exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing?
	How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these
	questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased
	activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined
	their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled
	with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default
	mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC
	and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant
	connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during
	rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased
	activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state
	connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all
	three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism
	for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive
	processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state
	connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling
	evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network.
	Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated
	by task demands and what functions it might subserve.},

	cognitive dysfunction is present when a person perceives failures
	of cognitive function. When annoying enough, these failures will
	be expressed as complaints. Subjective cognitive dysfunction may
	be a prelude to or coincide with objective cognitive impairment.
	WML have been related to objective cognitive impairment and dementia,
	but their relationship with subjective cognitive dysfunction is not
	clear. Previous population-based studies on the latter relationship
	have been limited in sample size, recording of subjective cognitive
	function, and assessment of WML severity. METHODS: We randomly sampled
	1,049 elderly nondemented participants from the general population.
	Data on subjective cognitive dysfunction and its progression were
	derived from a 15-item questionnaire. Objective cognitive performance
	was assessed using a series of neuropsychological tests. WML were
	scored on MRI for periventricular and subcortical regions separately.
	RESULTS: WML were associated with more subjective cognitive failures.
	WML were more severe for participants reporting progression of these
	failures compared with participants without these failures, especially
	within participants with better than average cognitive performance
	(p = 0.008, for periventricular WML). Participants with severe WML
	reported progression of cognitive failures more than twice as often
	than did those with little or no WML. The relationship between the
	severity of WML and subjective cognitive failures was present for
	periventricular and subcortical WML. CONCLUSIONS: WML are associated
	with subjective cognitive failures and in particular with reporting
	progression of these failures, even in the absence of objective cognitive
	impairment.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The role of functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging has
	become increasingly important in the presurgical mapping of gray
	matter. Neurosurgical interventions often involve fiber bundles that
	connect critical functional areas. Recently, diffusion-tensor (DT)
	imaging has enabled the visualization of fiber bundle direction and
	integrity, thus providing the ability to delineate clearly white
	matter from gray matter tissue. The main objective of this study
	was to improve the presurgical assessment of critical functionality
	in the vicinity of brain lesions by combining DT and fMR imaging
	methodologies. METHODS: Twenty patients with various space-occupying
	brain lesions underwent imaging for presurgical evaluation of motor
	and/or somatosensory functions. The authors focus on five patients
	with diverse space-occupying brain lesions. Diffusion tensor-based
	fiber tracking and fMR imaging activation maps were superimposed
	in three dimensions to visualize pyramidal tracts corresponding to
	motor and somatosensory regional activation. CONCLUSIONS: The combination
	of DT and fMR imaging for presurgical functional brain mapping provides
	valuable information that cannot be extracted using either method
	alone. The validity and sensitivity of noninvasive functional mapping
	for surgical guidance could be improved by considering results obtained
	with both methods. Furthermore, the use of three-dimensional visualization
	seems crucial and unique for viewing and understanding the complicated
	spatial relationship among the lesion, gray matter activation, and
	white matter fiber bundles.},

	the cortical location of the increased activity produced by each
	stimulus was recorded. The technique of functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) was used, in order to image the same subjects repeatedly.
	RESULTS: We found that each of the three motion stimuli activated
	specific parts of the V5 complex. These sites of activation overlap
	with V5 and, to a smaller extent, with each other. Unexpectedly,
	the three motion stimuli also activated neighbouring, but nonoverlapping,
	regions of auditory cortex that are normally activated by the perception
	of speech. CONCLUSIONS: The three sites of activation produced by
	the visual motion stimuli occupy adjacent territories within the
	V5 complex. Components of the V5 complex are specifically connected

	and structural neuroimaging correlates of major depression occurring
	after TBI. DESIGN: Prospective, case-controlled, surveillance study
	conducted during the first year after the traumatic episode occurred.
	Settings University hospital level I trauma center and a specialized
	rehabilitation unit. METHODS: The study group consisted of 91 patients
	with TBI. In addition, 27 patients with multiple traumas but without
	evidence of central nervous system injury constituted the control
	group. The patients' conditions were evaluated at baseline and at
	3, 6, and 12 months after the traumatic episode. Psychiatric diagnosis
	was made using a structured clinical interview and DSM-IV criteria.
	Neuropsychological testing and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging
	were performed at the 3-month follow-up visit. RESULTS: Major depressive
	disorder was observed in 30 (33\%) of 91 patients during the first
	year after sustaining a TBI. Major depressive disorder was significantly
	more frequent among patients with TBI than among the controls. Patients
	with TBI who had major depression were more likely to have a personal
	history of mood and anxiety disorders than patients who did not have
	major depression. Patients with major depression exhibited comorbid
	anxiety (76.7\%) and aggressive behavior (56.7\%). Patients with
	major depression had significantly greater impairment in executive
	functions than their nondepressed counterparts. Major depression
	was also associated with poorer social functioning at the 6-and 12-month
	follow-up, as well as significantly reduced left prefrontal gray
	matter volumes, particularly in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral
	regions. CONCLUSIONS: Major depression is a frequent complication
	of TBI that hinders a patient's recovery. It is associated with executive
	dysfunction, negative affect, and prominent anxiety symptoms. The
	neuropathological changes produced by TBI may lead to deactivation
	of lateral and dorsal prefrontal cortices and increased activation
	of ventral limbic and paralimbic structures including the amygdala.},

	(Mean +/- SD)=7.4 +/- 1 years, range=6-9 years) participated in an
	fMRI study of covert verb generation (VG). Results revealed significantly

	fluency and executive function. We also found significant associations

	neuropsychological tests (NEPSY verbal fluency score, Verbal IQ)
	and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. This study suggests that children
	with TBI have significantly different brain activation patterns in

	Although we found clear differences in brain activation between the
	two groups, conventional MR images showed no evidence of structural
	abnormalities in five of eight children with TBI. Our study demonstrates
	the feasibility and potential utility of fMRI as a means of quantifying
	changes associated with language deficits in future pediatric TBI

	of this study was to assess the combined use of functional (f) and
	diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assist
	in the preservation of the structure and function of the motor system.
	METHODS: The authors evaluated the combination of fMR imaging and
	DW MR imaging to detect cortical motor areas with their corresponding
	pyramidal tracts in 12 healthy volunteers and in 10 consecutive patients
	with various space-occupying lesions affecting the central motor
	system. Activation within the primary motor cortex (M1) and white
	matter bundles originating from this cortical region was demonstrated
	in 21 of the 22 individuals examined. Additional activation was exhibited
	along the course of white matter tracts at the level of the pons
	and. in the contralateral hemisphere, in the M1. Fiber tract displacement
	was visualized in all patients in white matter that had appeared
	normal on routine T1- and T2-weighted MR images. CONCLUSIONS: The
	combination of DW MR and fMR imaging allows visualization of the
	origin, direction, and functionality of large white matter tracts.
	This will prove helpful for imaging structural connectivity within
	the brain during functional imaging. Moreover, local relationships
	of cerebral tumors that encroach upon M1 and subcortical fiber tracts
	can be defined. This promises to decrease patient morbidity and to
	broaden the clinical applications of functional imaging.},

	MR imaging to characterize DAI in the setting of acute and subacute
	traumatic brain injury. METHODS: Nine patients ranging in age from
	26 to 78 years were examined with conventional MR imaging (including
	fast spin-echo T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery,
	and gradient-echo sequences) as well as echo-planar diffusion-weighted
	MR imaging 1 to 18 days after traumatic injury. Lesions were characterized
	as DAI on the basis of their location and their appearance on conventional
	MR images. Trace apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were computed
	off-line with the diffusion-weighted and base-line images. Areas
	of increased signal were identified on the diffusion-weighted images,
	and regions of interests were used to obtain trace ADC values. RESULTS:
	In the nine patients studied, isotropic diffusion-weighted images
	showed areas of increased signal with correspondingly decreased ADC.
	In one case, decreased ADC was seen 18 days after the initial event.
	CONCLUSION: Decreased ADC can be demonstrated in patients with DAI
	in the acute setting and may persist into the subacute period, beyond
	that described for cytotoxic edema in ischemia.},

  abstract = {Current analytical techniques applied to functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) data require a priori knowledge or specific assumptions
	about the time courses of processes contributing to the measured
	signals. Here we describe a new method for analyzing fMRI data based
	on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and
	Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We decomposed eight
	fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming,
	the Brown and Peterson work/number task, and control tasks into spatially
	independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values
	at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component "map"), and a unique
	associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points
	collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of
	spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived
	one and only one component with a time course closely matching the
	time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control
	tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related
	components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard
	correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected
	by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently
	task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order
	statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial
	independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a
	related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal
	Processing 36:11-20) were superior to principal component analysis
	(PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related
	activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions
	of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials
	and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement
	artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual fMRI
	data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to
	distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements,
	and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related
	fMRI activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial
	distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses.
	ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI
	data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering
	unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with
	performance of psychomotor tasks.},

	information and has therefore been widely used for preoperative planning
	of patients with mass lesions affecting functionally important brain
	regions. However, the courses of functionally important fiber tracts
	are not visualized. We therefore propose to combine fMRI with diffusion-weighted
	MRI (DWI) that allows visualization of large fiber tracts and to
	implement this data in a neuronavigation system. METHODS: DWI was
	successfully performed at a field strength of 1.5 Tesla, employing
	a spin-echo sequence with gradient sensitivity in six noncollinear
	directions to visualize the course of the pyramidal tracts, and was
	combined with echo-planar T2* fMRI during a hand motor task in a
	patient with central cavernoma. RESULTS: Fusion of both data sets
	allowed visualization of the displacement of both the primary sensorimotor
	area (M1) and its large descending fiber tracts. Intraoperatively,
	these data were used to aid in neuronavigation. Confirmation was
	obtained by intraoperative electrical stimulation. Postoperative
	MRI revealed an undisrupted pyramidal tract in the neurologically
	intact patient. CONCLUSION: The combination of fMRI with DWI allows
	for assessment of functionally important cortical areas and additional
	visualization of large fiber tracts. Information about the orientation
	of fiber tracts in normal appearing white matter in patients with
	tumors within the cortical motor system cannot be obtained by other
	functional or conventional imaging methods and is vital for reducing
	operative morbidity as the information about functional cortex. This
	technique might, therefore, have the prospect of guiding neurosurgical
	interventions, especially when linked to a neuronavigation system.},

	We measured indices derived from the diffusion tensor (DT) and T2-weighted
	signal intensities in the descending motor pathways of patients with
	small chronic lacunar infarcts of the posterior limb of the internal
	capsule on one side. We compared these measurements in the healthy
	and lesioned sides at different levels in the brainstem caudal to
	the primary lesion. We found that secondary white matter degeneration
	is revealed by a large reduction in diffusion anisotropy only in
	regions where fibers are arranged in isolated bundles of parallel
	fibers, such as in the cerebral peduncle. In regions where the degenerated
	pathway crosses other tracts, such as in the rostral pons, paradoxically
	there is almost no change in diffusion anisotropy, but a significant
	change in the measured orientation of fibers. The trace of the diffusion
	tensor is moderately increased in all affected regions. This allows
	one to differentiate secondary and primary fiber loss where the increase
	in trace is considerably higher. We show that DT-MRI is more sensitive
	than T2-weighted MRI in detecting Wallerian degeneration. Significant
	diffusion abnormalities are observed over the entire trajectory of
	the affected pathway in each patient. This finding suggests that
	mapping degenerated pathways noninvasively with DT-MRI is feasible.
	However, the interpretation of water diffusion data is complex and
	requires a priori information about anatomy and architecture of the
	pathway under investigation. In particular, our study shows that
	in regions where fibers cross, existing DT-MRI-based fiber tractography
	algorithms may lead to erroneous conclusion about brain connectivity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The corpus callosum is an important predilection
	site for traumatic axonal injury but may be unevenly affected in
	head trauma. We hypothesized that there were local differences in
	axonal injury within the corpus callosum as investigated with diffusion
	tensor imaging (DTI), varying among patients with differing severity
	of traumatic brain injury (TBI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee
	approval and informed consent were obtained. Ten control subjects
	(7 men, 3 women; mean age, 37 +/- 9 years) and 39 patients with TBI
	(27 men, 12 women; 34 +/- 12 years) were investigated, of whom 24
	had mild; 9, moderate; and 6, severe TBI. Regions of interest were
	selected in the callosal genu, body, and splenium to calculate fractional
	anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and the number
	of fibers passing through. Statistical comparison was made through
	analysis of variance with the Scheffé post hoc analysis. RESULTS:
	Compared with controls, patients with mild TBI investigated <3 months
	posttrauma (n = 12) had reduced FA (P < .01) and increased ADC (P
	< .05) in the genu, whereas patients with mild TBI investigated >
	or =3 months posttrauma (n = 12) showed no significant differences.
	Patients with moderate and severe TBI, all investigated <3 months
	posttrauma, had reduced FA (P < .001) and increased ADC (P < .01)
	in the genu compared with controls and reduced FA in the splenium
	(P < .001) without significant ADC change. CONCLUSION: Mild TBI is
	associated with DTI abnormalities in the genu <3 months posttrauma.
	In more severe TBI, both the genu and splenium are affected. DTI
	suggests a larger contribution of vasogenic edema in the genu than
	in the splenium in TBI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traumatic axonal injury is a primary brain
	abnormality in head trauma and is characterized by reduction of fractional
	anisotropy (FA) on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Our hypothesis
	was that patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) have widespread
	brain white matter regions of reduced FA involving a variety of fiber
	bundles and show fiber disruption on fiber tracking in a minority
	of these regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval
	and informed consent were obtained. Twenty-one patients with mild
	TBI were investigated (men:women, 12:9; mean age +/- SD, 32 +/- 9
	years). In a voxel-based comparison with 11 control subjects (men:women,
	8:3; mean age, 37 +/- 9 years) using z score analysis, patient regions
	with abnormally reduced FA were defined in brain white matter. MR
	imaging, DTI, and fiber tracking characteristics of these regions
	were described and analyzed using Pearson correlation, linear regression
	analysis, or the chi(2) test when appropriate. RESULTS: Patients
	had on average 9.1 regions with reduced FA, with a mean region volume
	of 525 mm(3), predominantly found in cerebral lobar white matter,
	cingulum, and corpus callosum. These regions mainly involved supratentorial
	projection fiber bundles, callosal fibers, and fronto-temporo-occipital
	association fiber bundles. Internal capsules and infratentorial white
	matter were relatively infrequently affected. Of all of the involved
	fiber bundles, 19.3\% showed discontinuity on fiber tracking. CONCLUSION:
	Patients with mild TBI have multiple regions with reduced FA in various
	white matter locations and involving various fiber bundles. A minority
	of these fiber bundles show discontinuity on fiber tracking.},

	studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the
	volume of normal and abnormal tissue signal as an index of tissue
	pathology. More recently, diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) has been employed
	to obtain regional measures of tissue microstructure, such as fractional
	anisotropy (FA), providing better spatial resolution and potentially
	more sensitive metrics of tissue damage than traditional volumetric
	measures. We used DTI to examine the regional basis of age-related
	alterations in prefrontal WM. As expected from prior volumetric and
	DTI studies, prefrontal FA was reduced in older adults (OA) compared
	to young adults (YA). Although WM volume has been reported to be
	relatively preserved until late aging, FA was significantly reduced
	by middle age. Much of prefrontal WM showed reduced FA with increasing
	age. Ventromedial and deep prefrontal regions showed a somewhat greater
	reduction compared to other prefrontal areas. Prefrontal WM anisotropy
	correlated with prefrontal WM volume, but the correlation was significant

	echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By the use of comparative
	MRI of 14 patients (age range, 22-62 years) on 1.5- and a 3 T (Tesla)
	systems at a median time interval of 61 months after traumatic brain
	injury (TBI), we found 239 (range 0.5-48.5, median 7.5) TMBs at 1.5
	T, and 470 (range 2-118, median 18.5) TMBs at 3 T, respectively (p=0.001).
	However, in all but one patients MRI at 1.5 T also clearly showed
	TMBs. A significant negative correlation between the number of TMBs
	and the time interval TBI-MRI was observed, which was weaker for
	the imaging at 3 T (r(s)=-0.798; p=0.001; and r(s)=-0.649; p=0.012,
	respectively). In conclusion, T2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI at 3
	T is superior as compared to MRI at 1.5 T for the detection of TMBs.
	Nevertheless, in clinical practice, MRI at 1.5 T seems to be sufficient
	for this purpose. MRI at 3 T may be appropriate if there is a strong
	clinical suspicion of DAI, despite unremarkable routine MRI, and
	possibly also if evidence of DAI is sought after a long interval

  abstract = {In vivo white matter tractography by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	has become a popular tool for investigation of white matter architecture
	in the normal brain. Despite some unresolved issues regarding the
	accuracy of DTI, recent studies applied DTI for delineating white
	matter organization in the vicinity of brain lesions and especially
	brain tumors. Apart from the intrinsic limitations of DTI, the tracking
	of fibers in the vicinity or within lesions is further complicated
	due to changes in diseased tissue such as elevated water content
	(edema), tissue compression and degeneration. These changes deform
	the architecture of the white matter and in some cases prevent definite
	selection of the seed region of interest (ROI) from which fiber tracking
	begins. We show here that for displaced fiber systems, the use of
	anatomical approach for seed ROI selection yields insufficient results.
	Alternatively, we propose to select the seed points based on functional
	MRI activations which constrain the subjective seed ROI selection.
	The results are demonstrated on two major fiber systems: the pyramidal
	tract and the superior longitudinal fasciculus that connect critical
	motor and language areas, respectively. The fMRI based seed ROI selection
	approach enabled a more comprehensive mapping of these fiber systems.
	Furthermore, this procedure enabled the characterization of displaced
	white matter using the eigenvalue decomposition of DTI. We show that
	along the compressed fiber system, the diffusivity parallel to the
	fiber increases, while that perpendicular to the fibers decreases,
	leading to an overall increase in the fractional anisotropy index
	reflecting the compression of the fiber bundle. We conclude that
	definition of the functional network of a subject with deformed white
	matter should be done carefully. With fMRI, one can more accurately
	define the seed ROI for DTI based tractography and to provide a more
	comprehensive, functionally related, white matter mapping, a very
	important tool used in pre-surgical mapping.},

	In addition, water diffusivity was bilaterally increased in the lentiform

  abstract = {Understanding functional connectivity within the brain is crucial
	to understanding neural function; even the simplest cognitive operations
	are supported by highly distributed neural circuits. We developed
	a novel method to measure task-related functional interactions between
	neural regions by applying coherence and partial coherence analyses
	to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Coherence and
	partial coherence are spectral measures that estimate the linear
	time-invariant (LTI) relationship between time series. They can be
	used to generate maps of task-specific connectivity associated with
	seed regions of interest (ROIs). These maps may then be compared
	across tasks, revealing nodes with task-related changes of connectivity
	to the seed ROI. To validate the method, we applied it to an event-related
	fMRI data set acquired while subjects performed two sequence tapping
	tasks, one of which required more bimanual coordination. Areas showing
	increased functional connectivity with both tasks were the same as
	those showing increased activity. Furthermore, though there were
	no significant differences in mean activity between the two tasks,
	significant increases in interhemispheric coherence were found between
	the primary motor (M1) and premotor (PM) regions for the task requiring
	more bimanual coordination. This increase in interhemispheric connectivity
	is supported by other brain imaging techniques as well as patient
	studies.},

	overall shape of each path is anatomically meaningful. By considering
	only the long-range similarity of path shapes, a method of constructing

	is first computed from an operator-selected seed voxel, located within

	and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured. The ADC
	was significantly higher in patients than in controls, and higher
	in the corpus callosum than in the pyramidal tracts for both groups.
	Using this method the different functional structures in the WM may

	with their global integration during perception and behavior. In
	this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity (CN),
	that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects
	of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a
	neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of
	small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of
	significant deviations from independence of large subsets. CN is
	then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical
	independence for subsets of increasing size. CN is shown to be high
	when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low
	when the components of a system are either completely independent
	(segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this
	complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine
	how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain
	brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral
	cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity
	organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity
	among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are
	associated with high values of CN. The approach outlined here may
	prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains

	of callosal axons in individuals with partial agenesis of the corpus
	callosum (pAgCC). We used tractography based on both diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)
	to investigate interhemispheric white matter connectivity in pAgCC.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and HARDI were performed at 3T on 6 individuals
	with pAgCC and 8 control subjects. For HARDI analysis, a Q-ball reconstruction
	method capable of visualizing multiple intravoxel fiber orientations
	was used. In both DTI and HARDI, whole-brain 3D fiber tractography
	was performed by using deterministic streamline algorithms. Callosal
	fibers were then segmented to identify separately connections between
	homologous cortical regions (homotopic fibers) and nonhomologous
	regions (heterotopic fibers) by using manually drawn regions of interest.
	RESULTS: In control individuals, we observed densely connected homotopic
	fibers. However, in individuals with pAgCC, we identified not only
	homotopic connections but also heterotopic connections in 4 of 6
	subjects. Furthermore, the observed homotopic connections in pAgCC
	did not necessarily correlate with the position or size of the residual
	callosum. The nature of homotopic and heterotopic connectivity varied
	considerably among subjects with pAgCC, and HARDI recovered more
	callosal fibers than DTI. CONCLUSION: Individuals with pAgCC demonstrate
	a remarkable diversity of callosal connectivity, including a number
	of heterotopic tracts that are absent in healthy subjects. The patterns
	of their callosal connections cannot be predicted from the appearance
	of their callosal fragments on conventional MR imaging. More tracts
	and more extensive fibers within tracts are recovered with HARDI
	than with DTI.},

	as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. The aim of this study was
	to investigate the cognitive functioning of patients with type 1
	diabetes (including a subgroup with a microvascular complication)
	and nondiabetic controls, and to assess the relationship between
	cognition and cerebral grey and white matter volumes. MATERIALS AND
	METHODS: Twenty-five patients with type 1 diabetes (of whom ten had
	proliferative retinopathy) and nine nondiabetic controls (matched
	in terms of sex, age and education) underwent a neuropsychological
	examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Fractional
	brain tissue volumes (tissue volume relative to total intracranial
	volume) were obtained from each participant. RESULTS: Compared with
	nondiabetic controls, patients with diabetes performed worse on tests
	measuring speed of information processing and visuoconstruction;
	patients with microvascular disease performed worse on the former
	cognitive domain (p = 0.03), whereas patients without complications
	performed worse on the latter domain (p = 0.01). Patients with a
	microvascular complication had a significantly smaller white matter
	volume than nondiabetic controls (p = 0.04), and smaller white matter
	volume was associated with worse performance on the domains of speed
	of information processing and attention and executive function. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:
	Patients with diabetes demonstrated several subtle neuropsychological
	deficits, which were found to be related to white matter volume.
	Since patients with diabetic retinopathy had a smaller white matter
	volume, this suggests that cognitive decline is at least partly mediated
	by microvascular disease. This needs to be addressed in future studies.},

	and time-sharing ability in dual-task performance. Behavioural laterality
	as measured by dichotic word listening, line bisection and turning
	bias tests correlated inversely with the midsagittal cross-sectional
	area of the corpus callosum, as seen on MRI. The amount of dual task
	interference was strongly inversely correlated with the callosal
	area in both within-hemisphere and between-hemispheres conditions.
	These relationships between normal variations in callosal area, and
	outcomes on tests both of laterally and time-sharing capacity in
	normal adults suggest that the corpus callosum assumes a cross-excitatory
	role when subjects perform these tasks.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The mediodorsal and anteroventral/anteromedial nuclei of
	the thalamus are brain regions of interest in the study of mood disorders
	because they connect subcortical limbic system structures such as
	the amygdala with the prefrontal, cingulate, and temporal cortices.
	Anatomical abnormalities have been observed both in the amygdala
	and in the aforementioned cortical regions in affective disorder
	patients. Neuroanatomical studies of the thalamus have rarely been
	conducted in patients with mood disorders. METHOD: Postmortem tissue
	from the Stanley Foundation Brain Bank was obtained from subjects
	diagnosed with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia
	as well as a nonpsychiatric comparison group (N=10-13 per group).
	The optical disector stereological procedure was used to count neurons
	in the mediodorsal and anteroventral/anteromedial nuclei of the thalamus
	in each brain. RESULTS: There were significantly more neurons in
	the mediodorsal (37\%) and anteroventral/anteromedial (26\%) nuclei
	in subjects with major depressive disorder relative to the nonpsychiatric
	comparison subjects. Neuron numbers and volumes in these limbic thalamic
	nuclei were normal in the schizophrenia and bipolar subjects. CONCLUSIONS:
	The data indicate that there is an elevation in total neuron number
	in the limbic thalamus that is specific for major depressive disorder.
	This represents the first report of a neuropsychiatric disorder being
	associated with an increase in total regional neuron number. The
	present findings, along with recent data, indicate that significant
	anatomical and functional abnormalities are present in limbic circuits
	in major depressive disorder.},

  abstract = {We have used positron emission tomography (PET), which measures regional
	cerebral blood flow (rCBF), to demonstrate directly the specialization
	of function in the normal human visual cortex. A novel technique,
	statistical parametric mapping, was used to detect foci of significant
	change in cerebral blood flow within the prestriate cortex, in order
	to localize those parts involved in the perception of color and visual
	motion. For color, we stimulated the subjects with a multicolored
	abstract display containing no recognizable objects (Land color Mondrian)
	and contrasted the resulting blood flow maps with those obtained
	when subjects viewed an identical display consisting of equiluminous
	shades of gray. The comparison identified a unique area (area V4)
	located in the lingual and fusiform gyri of the prestriate cortex.
	For motion, blood flow maps when subjects viewed moving or stationary
	black and white random-square patterns were contrasted. The comparison
	identified a unique area located in the region of the temporo-parieto-occipital
	junction (area V5). We thus provide direct evidence to show that,
	just as in the macaque monkey, different areas of the human prestriate
	visual cortex are specialized for different attributes of vision.
	The striate cortex (V1) and the contiguous visual area (V2), which
	in the monkey brain feed both the homologous areas, were active in
	all 4 conditions. This pattern of activity allowed us to use an extension
	of the approach to assess the functional relationship between the
	3 areas during color and motion stimulation. This is based on an
	hypothesis-led analysis of the covariance structure of the blood
	flow maps and promises to be a powerful tool for inferring anatomical
	pathways in the normal human brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  journal = {Med Image Anal},
  year = {2010},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging plays a key role in our understanding of
	white matter both in normal populations and in populations with brain
	disorders. Existing techniques focus primarily on using diffusivity-based
	quantities derived from diffusion tensor as surrogate measures of
	microstructural tissue properties of white matter. In this paper,
	we describe a novel tract-specific framework that enables the examination
	of white matter morphometry at both the macroscopic and microscopic
	scales. The framework leverages the skeleton-based modeling of sheet-like
	white matter fasciculi using the continuous medial representation,
	which gives a natural definition of thickness and supports its comparison
	across subjects. The thickness measure provides a macroscopic characterization
	of white matter fasciculi that complements existing analysis of microstructural
	features. The utility of the framework is demonstrated in quantifying
	white matter atrophy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a severe neurodegenerative
	disease of motor neurons. We show that, compared to using microscopic
	features alone, combining the macroscopic and microscopic features
	gives a more complete characterization of the disease.},
