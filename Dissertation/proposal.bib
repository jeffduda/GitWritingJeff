  abstract = {Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks.
	Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers
	in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation
	matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical
	and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation
	matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks,
	we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient
	in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length
	(2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network,
	whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters
	have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the
	macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical
	core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated
	power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions
	of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections
	to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal
	association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were
	topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to
	targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network,
	but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated,
	low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world
	architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity
	of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical
	for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate
	for segregated and distributed information processing.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) is an emerging imaging modality
	whose importance has been growing considerably. However, the processing
	of this type of data (i.e., symmetric positive-definite matrices),
	called "tensors" here, has proved difficult in recent years. Usual
	Euclidean operations on matrices suffer from many defects on tensors,
	which have led to the use of many ad hoc methods. Recently, affine-invariant
	Riemannian metrics have been proposed as a rigorous and general framework
	in which these defects are corrected. These metrics have excellent
	theoretical properties and provide powerful processing tools, but
	also lead in practice to complex and slow algorithms. To remedy this
	limitation, a new family of Riemannian metrics called Log-Euclidean
	is proposed in this article. They also have excellent theoretical
	properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler
	and faster computations. This new approach is based on a novel vector
	space structure for tensors. In this framework, Riemannian computations
	can be converted into Euclidean ones once tensors have been transformed
	into their matrix logarithms. Theoretical aspects are presented and
	the Euclidean, affine-invariant, and Log-Euclidean frameworks are
	compared experimentally. The comparison is carried out on interpolation
	and regularization tasks on synthetic and clinical 3D DTI data.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to propose methods for assessing the reproducibility
	of diffusion tractography algorithms in future clinical studies and
	to show their application to the tractography algorithm developed
	in our unit, fast marching tractography (FMT). FMT estimates anatomical
	connectivity between brain regions using the information provided
	by diffusion tensor imaging. Three major white-matter pathways were
	investigated in 11 normal subjects--anterior callosal fibers, optic
	radiations, and pyramidal tracts. FMT was used to generate maps of
	connectivity metric, and regions of voxels with highest connectivity
	metric to an anatomically defined starting point were identified
	for each tract under investigation. The reproducibilities of tract-"normalized"
	volume (NV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements were assessed
	over such regions. The values of tract volumes are consistent with
	the postmortem data. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for FA and NV
	ranged from 1.7 to 7.1\% and from 2.2 to 18.6\%, respectively. CVs
	were lowest in the anterior callosal fibers (range: 1.7- 7.8\%),
	followed by the optic radiations (range: 1.2-18.6\%) and pyramidal
	tracts (range: 2.6-15.5\%), suggesting that fiber organization plays
	a role in determining the level of FMT reproducibility. In conclusion,
	these findings underline the importance of assessing the reliability
	of diffusion tractography before investigating white matter pathology.},

  abstract = {Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become the major imaging
	modality to study properties of white matter and the geometry of
	fiber tracts of the human brain. Clinical studies mostly focus on
	regional statistics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
	(MD) derived from tensors. Existing analysis techniques do not sufficiently
	take into account that the measurements are tensors, and thus require
	proper interpolation and statistics of tensors, and that regions

	a new framework for quantitative tract-oriented DTI analysis that

	nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. A new measure of tensor anisotropy,
	called geodesic anisotropy (GA) is applied and compared with FA.
	As a result, tracts of interest are represented by the geometry of
	the medial spine attributed with tensor statistics (average and variance)
	calculated within cross-sections. Feasibility of our approach is
	demonstrated on various fiber tracts of a single data set. A validation
	study, based on six repeated scans of the same subject, assesses
	the reproducibility of this new DTI data analysis framework.},

	fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence
	of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows.
	The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time
	as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings
	between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the
	existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked
	by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying
	structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds)
	we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and
	find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes,
	contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer
	entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent
	correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

  abstract = {To understand the effects of a cortical lesion it is necessary to
	consider not only the loss of local neural function, but also the
	lesion-induced changes in the larger network of endogenous oscillatory
	interactions in the brain. To investigate how network embedding influences
	a region's functional role, and the consequences of its being damaged,
	we implement two models of oscillatory cortical interactions, both
	of which inherit their coupling architecture from the available anatomical
	connection data for macaque cerebral cortex. In the first model,
	node dynamics are governed by Kuramoto phase oscillator equations,
	and we investigate the sequence in which areas entrain one another
	in the transition to global synchrony. In the second model, node
	dynamics are governed by a more realistic neural mass model, and
	we assess long-run inter-regional interactions using a measure of
	directed information flow. Highly connected parietal and frontal
	areas are found to synchronize most rapidly, more so than equally
	highly connected visual and somatosensory areas, and this difference
	can be explained in terms of the network's clustered architecture.
	For both models, lesion effects extend beyond the immediate neighbors
	of the lesioned site, and the amplitude and dispersal of nonlocal
	effects are again influenced by cluster patterns in the network.
	Although the consequences of in vivo lesions will always depend on
	circuitry local to the damaged site, we conclude that lesions of
	parietal regions (especially areas 5 and 7a) and frontal regions
	(especially areas 46 and FEF) have the greatest potential to disrupt
	the integrative aspects of neocortical function.},

	that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within

	to the probability of being connected by nervous fibers. This probability
	is estimated by means of probabilistic tissue segmentation and intravoxel
	white matter orientational distribution function, obtained from anatomical

	assessment of probabilistic brain anatomical connection maps. In
	a second step, for assessing anatomical connectivity between K gray
	matter structures, the previous graph is redefined as a K+1 partite
	graph by partitioning the initial nodes set in K non-overlapped gray
	matter subsets and one subset clustering the remaining nodes. Three
	different measures are proposed for quantifying anatomical connections

	(ACS), Anatomical Connection Density (ACD) and Anatomical Connection
	Probability (ACP). This methodology was applied to both artificial

	Anatomical connectivity in white matter is obtained from measurements

	probability that a particle diffuses between two points, with the
	probability of a jump in a particular direction from a given voxel
	being based on the local value of the diffusion tensor components.
	Functional connectivity between grey matter pixels is assessed without
	recourse to a specific activation paradigm, by calculating the correlation
	coefficient between random fluctuations in the blood oxygenation
	level-dependent signal time course in different pixels. The methods
	are used to examine the anatomical and functional connectivities
	between crowns of adjacent gyri. A high functional connectivity was
	found between grey matter pixels, with white matter displaying only
	very low correlation. A comparison of the measurements of anatomical
	and functional connectivity found that there is no simple correlation
	between these measures, except that low values of functional connectivity
	were not found together with high values of anatomical connectivity.
	Furthermore pairs of regions situated around the central sulcus indicated
	a dependence of the two connectivity measures on each other. These
	results are in accordance with an interpretation that regions which
	are clearly directly linked by white matter fiber tracts should show
	high functional connectivity, but that the inverse need not be true

	the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left AF),
	and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to higher lambda(1),

	By mapping the significance levels onto the tractography trajectories

  abstract = {Connection patterns of the cerebral cortex consist of pathways linking
	neuronal populations across multiple levels of scale, from whole
	brain regions to local minicolumns. This nested interconnectivity
	suggests the hypothesis that cortical connections are arranged in
	fractal or self-similar patterns. We describe a simple procedure
	to generate fractal connection patterns that aim at capturing the
	potential self-similarity and hierarchical ordering of neuronal connections.
	We examine these connection patterns by calculating a broad range
	of structural measures, including small-world attributes and motif
	composition, as well as some global measures of functional connectivity,
	including complexity. As we vary fractal patterns by changing a critical
	control parameter, we find strongly correlated changes in several
	structural and functional measures, suggesting that they emerge together
	and are mutually linked. Measures obtained from some modeled fractal
	patterns closely resemble those of real neuroanatomical data sets,
	supporting the original hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Brain regions in the mammalian cerebral cortex are linked by a complex
	network of fiber bundles. These inter-regional networks have previously
	been analyzed in terms of their node degree, structural motif, path
	length and clustering coefficient distributions. In this paper we
	focus on the identification and classification of hub regions, which
	are thought to play pivotal roles in the coordination of information
	flow. We identify hubs and characterize their network contributions
	by examining motif fingerprints and centrality indices for all regions
	within the cerebral cortices of both the cat and the macaque. Motif
	fingerprints capture the statistics of local connection patterns,
	while measures of centrality identify regions that lie on many of
	the shortest paths between parts of the network. Within both cat
	and macaque networks, we find that a combination of degree, motif
	participation, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality allows
	for reliable identification of hub regions, many of which have previously
	been functionally classified as polysensory or multimodal. We then
	classify hubs as either provincial (intra-cluster) hubs or connector
	(inter-cluster) hubs, and proceed to show that lesioning hubs of
	each type from the network produces opposite effects on the small-world
	index. Our study presents an approach to the identification and classification
	of putative hub regions in brain networks on the basis of multiple
	network attributes and charts potential links between the structural
	embedding of such regions and their functional roles.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recovery from focal motor pathway lesions may be associated
	with a functional reorganisation of cortical motor areas. Previous
	studies of the relation between structural brain damage and the functional
	consequences have employed MRI and CT, which provide limited structural
	information. The recent development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	now provides quantitative measures of fibre tract integrity and orientation.
	The objective was to use DTI and functional MRI (fMRI) to determine
	the mechanisms underlying the excellent recovery found after a penetrating
	injury to the right capsular region. METHODS: DTI and fMRI were performed
	on the patient described; DTI was performed on five normal controls.
	RESULTS: The injury resulted in a left hemiplegia which resolved
	fully over several weeks. When studied 18 months later there was
	no pyramidal weakness, a mild hemidystonia, and sensory disturbance.
	fMRI activation maps showed contralateral primary and supplementary
	motor cortex activation during tapping of each hand; smaller ipsilateral
	primary motor areas were activated by the recovered hand only. DTI
	disclosed preserved structural integrity and orientation in the posterior
	capsular limb by contrast with the disrupted structure in the anterior
	limb on the injured side. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that
	the main recovery mechanism was a preservation of the integrity and
	orientation of pyramidal tract fibres. The fMRI studies do not suggest
	substantial reorganisation of the motor cortex, although ipsilateral
	pathways may have contributed to the recovery. The initial deficit
	was probably due to reversible local factors including oedema and
	mass effect; permanent damage to fibre tracts in the anterior capsular
	limb may account for the persistent sensory deficit. This study shows
	for the first time the potential value of combining fMRI and DTI
	together to investigate mechanisms of recovery and persistent deficit
	in an individual patient.},

	imaging (DTI) allows a full characterization of water molecule mobility
	in three dimensions, providing new structural information that is
	not available from other in vivo imaging techniques. The directional
	bias of diffusion (anisotropy) may be derived from the diffusion
	tensor, and is related to fiber tract integrity and orientation.
	Since DTI and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) both require
	rapid (generally echoplanar) imaging it is possible to obtain geometrically
	matched images from the two modalities. fMRI and DTI were combined
	in a visual system study using photic stimulation to demonstrate
	the feasibility of combining the two methods and to investigate the
	structural properties of activated regions compared to the white
	matter tracts. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI activation
	maps were directly overlayed upon fractional anisotropy (FA) maps,
	avoiding registration and spatial transformation by carefully matching
	acquisition parameters. Activated regions had lower FA than optic
	radiation white matter, supporting the hypothesis that most BOLD
	signal change occurs within the relatively isotropic cortical grey
	matter. The combination of these modalities in future studies may
	provide further insights into relationships between brain structure

	(DTI) is needed to objectively follow disease progression in therapeutic

	The noise variability of nonlinear quantities of the diffusion tensor

	quantified using the bootstrap, in which the data are resampled from
	the experimental averages, yet this approach is only applicable to
	DTI scans that contain multiple averages from the same sampling direction.
	It has been shown that DTI acquisitions with a modest to large number
	of directions, in which each direction is only sampled once, outperform
	the multiple averages approach. These acquisitions resist the traditional
	(regular) bootstrap analysis though. In contrast to the regular bootstrap,
	the wild bootstrap method can be applied to such protocols in which
	there is only one observation per direction. Here, we compare and
	contrast the wild bootstrap with the regular bootstrap using Monte
	Carlo numerical simulations for a number of diffusion scenarios.
	The regular and wild bootstrap methods are applied to human DTI data
	and empirical distributions are obtained for fractional anisotropy
	and the diffusion tensor eigensystem. Spatial maps of the estimated
	variability in the diffusion tensor principal eigenvector are provided.
	The wild bootstrap method can provide empirical distributions for

	eigenvector direction, even when the exact distributions are not
