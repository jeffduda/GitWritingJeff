%Let me first thank James Gee, Ph.D., my thesis advisor.

% for his
%patience and encouragement during my Ph.D. and his support of my
%medical education.  He is a great mentor, one with whom I have had the
%privilege to work and from whom I continue to learn.  Second, I am
%grateful to my thesis committee---Susan Margulies,
%Ph.D. (Bioengineering), Hiroto Hatabu, M.D. Ph.D. (BIDMC), Talissa
%Altes, M.D. (CHOP) and Joel Cooper, M.D. (Surgery)---for their helpful
%suggestions and clinical insight.  All of them are great academic role
%models, and I aspire to emulate their success.

%I have been fortunate to work with many collaborators in addition to
%Hiroto.  I thank Ichiro Hasegawa, M.D. (BIDMC) and Hidemasa Uematsu,
%Ph.D.  (U. Fukui, Japan), for their assistance in selecting and
%identifying the vascular landmarks for the initial human 2-D MR
%study.  I am grateful to Shigeru Kiryu, Ph.D. (U. Tokyo, Japan), who
%provided the data and segmentations for the murine SCD experiments and
%the preliminary 3-D human MR analysis.  My sincere thanks to Masaya
%Takahashi, Ph.D. (BIDMC) and Shigeto Kubo, Ph.D. (BIDMC), who have
%provided all the MR data for the studies in this dissertation, and
%with whom I have worked closely on the murine studies.  I am
%particularly grateful for the time and energy invested by Shigeto Kubo
%and Takeshi Kubo, Ph.D. (BIDMC), who placed landmarks on the 2-D
%free-breathing human MR data as well as the 2-D and 3-D murine
%datasets.  Similarly, I am thankful to Mizuki Nishino (BIDMC), who
%spent a great deal of time segmenting lung lobes on the HRCT data.

%I sincerely appreciate the efforts of Jose Miguel Hidalgo (Universidad
%de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia) and Juan Camilo Marquez, M.D.,
%(Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia) in identifying
%the landmarks on the HRCT and 4DCT data.  With extremely short notice,
%they generously spent many hours after work each day meticulously
%identifying landmarks.


%I also wish to thank Christos Davatzikos, Ph.D. (Radiology), Mitch
%Schnall, M.D. Ph.D. (Radiology), Punam Saha, Ph.D. (MIPG), David
%Shera, Ph.D. (CHOP) and Drew Torigian, M.D. (Radiology), for their
%thought-provoking questions, helpful discussions of current and future
%experiments, and long-term perspectives on the study of pulmonary
%kinematics.  I am also grateful to Leon Axel, Ph.D. M.D. (NYU) and
%Elliot McVeigh, Ph.D. (NIH/JHU), for the privilege of working with
%them on various cardiac MR image analysis projects early during my
%Ph.D. and during my masters, respectively.  Both are inspiring
%scientists and I thank them for the opportunity to learn from them.
%Thanks to Scott Reeder, M.D. Ph.D. (U. Wisconsin), who convinced me
%that I had what it took to do an MD/PhD.

%Thanks to Leon for offering me a spot in his lab when I first started
%at Penn and giving me a chance to work with one of the greatest minds
%in cardiac MRI.  Thanks to Elliot for giving me my start in the
%research world, and for showing me that the brain wasn't the only cool
%thing in the body to image.

%Thanks to the great folks at PICSL, who are incredibly smart.  I
%am honored to call them friends, not just co-workers.  To thank each
%of them for their help would take many pages, so instead I list them
%here.  Special thanks
%to Jeff and Brian, who answered all my stupid questions when I first
%joined the lab, and with whom I've grown up in the research world.

%I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the wonderful people of
%PICSL.  I am honored to call you friends as well as colleagues.  In
%particular, thanks to Jeff Duda, for being a good friend and for
%teaching me IDL when I first joined the lab.  Thanks to Brian Avants,
%Ph.D., for answering all my questions, no matter how silly and
%endless.  Thanks to Paul Yushkevich, Ph.D., Pablo Burstein, Ph.D. and
%Nick Tustison, D.Sc., for their entertaining stories and helpful
%suggestions.

%Thanks to my extended family for their encouragement, despite their
%bemusement at the number of years I've spent in graduate school.
%Special thanks to my Uncle Joe for his long-distance pep talks that
%hearken back to the completion of his own doctorate, and to my Uncle
%Anand for being so excited at having another doctor in the family.

%Thanks to my parents for their unconditional love and support.  For
%listening to my problems even though they didn't entirely understand
%what I was working on or why it was taking so long, for their
%compassion despite my irritability and frustration, for their
%inspiration, I am eternally grateful.

%And finally, I wish to thank Phil Cook, my love and husband-to-be, for
%inspiring me, keeping me going when I wanted to give up, and always
%knowing when to reboot.





%Thanks to Jim for supporting my clinical life, nurturing my research
%abilities, and teaching us about more than just science.  Thanks to
%the folks at Beth Israel (Masaya, Shigeto and Shigeru for the MR data;
%Mizuki and Hiroto for the CT data) for all their work in data
%acquisition and for the occasional glimpses into the exciting and fascinating 
%world of diagnostic radiology.

%The authors wish to thank Drs. Hiroto Hatabu, Ichiro Hasegawa, Shigeru
%Kiryu and Masaya Takahashi of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
%(Boston, MA, USA), and Dr. Hidemasa Uematsu of Fukui Medical
%University (Fukui, Japan), for providing the datasets and expert
%vascular landmarks for the preliminary 2-D MR and 3-D HRCT
%experiments, as well as for their helpful discussions.

%Thanks to Punam Saha and David Shera for helpful discussions.

%We sincerely acknowledge the contributions of Shigeto Kubo, Ph.D. (2-D
%human and murine landmark identification, 3-D murine landmark
%identification, regional segmentation of 2-D data) and Takeshi Kubo,
%Ph.D. (landmark identification, 2-D human and murine data) to the
%studies discussed in this chapter.


%Thanks to my committee for their invaluable input and suggestions.
%Each of you is a great role model for the different ways in which
%clinical and research careers can be combined, and I hope to emulate
%your success someday.  FIXME: More here for each individual?

%Thanks to family and friends for putting up with my crap, even when
%they didn't really understand what I was doing or why it took so long.
%FIXME: More here.  Special thanks to my uncle Joe, who knows the
%trials of writing a dissertation, for his long-distance prayers and
%support.
