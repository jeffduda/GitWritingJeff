  abstract = {The vegetative state is often described clinically as loss of function
	of the cortex while the function of the brainstem is preserved. In
	an attempt to define the structural basis of the vegetative state
	we have undertaken a detailed neuropathological study of the brains
	of 49 patients who remained vegetative until death, 1 month to 8
	years after an acute brain insult. Of these, 35 had sustained a blunt
	head injury and 14 some type of acute non-traumatic brain damage.
	In the traumatic cases the commonest structural abnormalities identified
	were grades 2 and 3 diffuse axonal injury (25 cases, 71\%). The thalamus
	was abnormal in 28 cases (80\%), and in 96\% of the cases who survived
	for more than 3 months. Other abnormalities included ischaemic damage
	in the neocortex (13 cases, 37\%) and intracranial haematoma (nine
	cases, 26\%). In the non-traumatic cases there was diffuse ischaemic
	damage in the neocortex in nine cases (64\%) and focal damage in
	four (29\%); the thalamus was abnormal in every case. There were
	cases in both groups where the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum and
	the brainstem were of structurally normal appearance. In every case,
	however, there was profound damage to the subcortical white matter
	or to the major relay nuclei of the thalamus, or both. These lesions
	render any structurally intact cortex unable to function because
	connections between different cortical areas via the thalamic nuclei
	are no longer functional, and there is also extensive damage to afferent
	and efferent cerebral connections.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with fiber tractography
	(FT) could be useful for exploration of the state of the corticospinal
	tract (CST) at the subcortical white matter level. The purpose of
	this study was to demonstrate focal lesions of the CST in patients
	with diffuse axonal injury (DAI), using DTI with FT. DESIGN: Two
	patients with DAI and six normal control subjects were recruited
	to this study. DTI was performed using 1.5-T with a synergy-L Sensitivity
	Encoding (SENSE) head coil. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent
	diffusion coefficients (ADC) were measured using a region of interest
	(ROI) method. FTs were obtained with FA <0.3 and an angle change
	>45 degrees as termination criteria. RESULTS: On the DTI with FT,
	the focal lesions, which could not observed using routine brain MRI,
	were detected in the left brainstem of patient 1 and in the right
	pons and the left and right medulla of patient 2. The patients showed
	significantly decreased FA values in the focal lesions compared to
	normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: DTI with FT demonstrated focal lesions
	at the brainstem that had not been revealed by conventional brain
	MRI; these focal lesions explained the weaknesses of the patients.
	We conclude that DTI with FT may be a useful modality for use in
	investigating the status of CST in patients with DAI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Disruption of the cytoskeletal network and
	axonal membranes characterizes diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the
	first few hours after traumatic brain injury. Histologic abnormalities
	seen in DAI hypothetically decrease the diffusion along axons and
	increase the diffusion in directions perpendicular to them. DAI therefore
	is hypothetically associated in the short term with decreased diffusion
	anisotropy. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the diffusion
	characteristics of traumatized brain tissue with use of diffusion
	tensor MR imaging. METHODS: Five patients with mild traumatic brain
	injuries and 10 control subjects were studied with CT, conventional
	MR imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. All patients were examined
	within 24 hours of injury. In each participant, diffusion tensor
	indices from homologous normal-appearing white matter regions of
	both hemispheres were compared. These indices were also compared
	between homologous regions of each patient and the control group.
	In two patients, diffusion tensor images from the immediate post-trauma
	period were compared with those at 1 month follow-up. RESULTS: Patients
	displayed significant reduction of diffusion anisotropy in several
	regions compared with the homologous ones in the contralateral hemisphere.
	Such differences were not observed in the control subjects. Significant
	reduction of diffusion anisotropy was also detected when diffusion
	tensor results from the patients were compared with those of the
	controls. This reduction was often less evident 1 month after injury.
	CONCLUSION: White matter regions with reduced anisotropy are detected
	in the first 24 hours after traumatic brain injury. Therefore, diffusion
	tensor imaging may be a powerful technique for in vivo detection
	of DAI.},

  abstract = {Advanced neuroimaging techniques are now used to expand our knowledge
	of traumatic brain injury, and increasingly, they are being applied
	to children. This review will examine four of these methods as they
	apply to children who present acutely after injury. (1) Susceptibility
	weighted imaging is a 3-dimensional high-resolution magnetic resonance
	imaging technique that is more sensitive than conventional imaging
	in detecting hemorrhagic lesions that are often associated with diffuse
	axonal injury. (2) Magnetic resonance spectroscopy acquires metabolite
	information reflecting neuronal integrity and function from multiple
	brain regions and provides sensitive, noninvasive assessment of neurochemical
	alterations that offers early prognostic information regarding the
	outcome. (3) Diffusion weighted imaging is based on differences in
	diffusion of water molecules within the brain and has been shown
	to be very sensitive in the early detection of ischemic injury. It
	is now being used to study the direct effects of traumatic injury
	as well as those due to secondary ischemia. (4) Diffusion tensor
	imaging is a form of diffusion weighted imaging and allows better
	evaluation of white matter fiber tracts by taking advantage of the
	intrinsic directionality (anisotropy) of water diffusion in human
	brain. It has been shown to be useful in identifying white matter
	abnormalities after diffuse axonal injury when conventional imaging
	appears normal. An important aspect of these advanced methods is
	that they demonstrate that 'normal-appearing' brain in many instances
	is not normal, i.e. there is evidence of significant undetected injury
	that may underlie a child's clinical status. Availability and integration
	of these advanced imaging methods will lead to better treatment and
	change the standard of care for use of neuroimaging to evaluate children
	with traumatic brain injury.},

	disease, cerebral infarction, and cognitive dysfunction. This study

	Thirty-six children and adolescents with SCD (age range, 9-24 years)
	and 31 controls (8-25 years) underwent magnetic resonance investigations
	using T1- and T2-weighted protocols. White and gray matter density
	maps were obtained from three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) data sets. Using VBM, we compared the maps between controls
	and SCD individuals with silent white matter infarct lesions (SCD+L;
	n = 16), and those without visible abnormality (SCD-L; n = 20). RESULTS:
	In comparison with controls, intelligence quotients (IQs) were lower
	in both SCD groups irrespective of presence of visible lesions. VBM
	showed widespread bilateral white matter abnormalities in the SCD+L
	group, extending beyond the regions of focal infarction in the deep
	anterior and posterior white matter borderzones. Bilateral white
	matter abnormalities were also observed in the SCD-L group, in locations
	similar to those in the SCD+L group. INTERPRETATION: VBM is sensitive
	to detection of widespread white matter injury in SCD patients in
	borderzones between arterial territories even in the absence of evidence
	of infarction. Those changes may contribute to cognitive deficits
	in this population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the imaging, spectroscopic, and diffusion characteristics
	of brains of infants with neonatal encephalopathy have been described,
	the time course during which these changes evolve is not clear. The
	results of sequential MR imaging studies--including anatomic MR imaging,
	proton MR spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)--of 10
	patients enrolled prospectively in a study of neonatal encephalopathy
	are reported to help to clarify the time course of changes in different
	brain regions during the first 2 weeks of life. METHODS: Ten neonates
	were prospectively enrolled in a study of the evolution of MR findings
	in neonatal encephalopathy and were studied 2 (8 patients) or 3 (2
	patients) times within the first 2 weeks of life. The MR examination
	included spin-echo T1 and T2-weighted images, DTI, and long echo
	time (288 milliseconds) proton MR spectroscopy. Diffusion parameters
	(diffusivity [D(av)], fractional anisotropy [FA], and individual
	eigenvalues) were calculated for 10 1-cm2 regions of interest in
	each hemisphere that were placed based on anatomic landmarks. D(av)
	and FA were then measured manually in the same areas on a workstation.
	Metabolite ratios (NAA/Ch, Cr/Ch, Cr/NAA, Lac/Ch, and Lac/NAA) were
	calculated in 7 regions of interest. Imaging appearance, diffusion
	parameters, and metabolite ratios were then evaluated longitudinally
	(comparing with other studies on the same patient at different times)
	and cross-sectionally (comparing all studies performed on the same
	postnatal day). RESULTS: In most of the patients a characteristic
	evolution of DTI and MR spectroscopy parameters was seen during the
	first 2 weeks after birth. Although the anatomic images were normal
	or nearly normal on the first 2 days after birth in most patients,
	abnormalities were detected on DTI (both visually and by quantitative
	interrogation of D(av) maps) and proton MR spectroscopy (abnormal
	metabolite ratios). These parameters tended to worsen until about
	day 5 and then normalize, though in several patients abnormal metabolite
	ratios persisted. Of interest, as areas of abnormal diffusivity pseudonormalized
	within one region of the brain they would develop in other areas.
	Therefore, the pattern of injury looked very different when imaging
	was performed at different times during this evolution. CONCLUSION:
	Patterns of injury detected by standard anatomic imaging sequences,
	DTI sequences, and proton MR spectroscopy varied considerably during
	the first 2 weeks after injury. The appearance of new areas of reduced
	diffusion simultaneous with the pseudonormalization of areas that
	had reduced diffusion at earlier times can result in an entirely
	different pattern of injury on diffusivity maps acquired at different
	time points. Awareness of these evolving patterns is essential if
	studies are performed and interpreted during this critical period
	of time.},

	highly anisotropic in white matter fibers owing to axonal length.
	Recently, DTI has been used to investigate traumatic axonal injury
	(TAI), emphasizing regional analysis in more severe TBI. In the current
	study, we hypothesized that a global white matter (WM) analysis of
	DTI data would be sensitive to TAI across a spectrum of TBI severity
	and injury to scan interval. To investigate this, we compared WM-only
	histograms of a scalar, fractional anisotropy (FA), between 20 heterogeneous
	TBI patients recruited from Detroit Medical Center, including six
	mild TBI (GCS 13-15), and 14 healthy age-matched controls. FA histogram
	parameters were correlated with admission GCS and posttraumatic amnesia
	(PTA). In all cases, including mild TBI, patients' FA histograms
	were globally decreased compared with control histograms. The shape
	of the TBI histograms also differed from controls, being more peaked
	and skewed. The mean FA, kurtosis and skewness were highly correlated
	suggesting a common mechanism. FA histogram properties also correlated
	with injury severity indexed by GCS and PTA, with mean FA being the
	best predictor and duration of PTA (r = 0.64) being superior to GCS
	(r = 0.47). Therefore, in this heterogeneous sample, the FA mean
	accounted for 40\% of the variance in PTA. Increased diffusion in
	the short axis dimension, likely reflecting dysmyelination and swelling
	of axons, accounted for most of the FA decrease. FA is globally deceased
	in WM, including mild TBI, possibly reflecting widespread involvement.
	FA changes appear to be correlated with injury severity suggesting
	a role in early diagnosis and prognosis of TBI.},

	while decreases in ADC were identified in cortical gray matter (GM).
	Regions of positive correlation between ADC and age were also found

	using functional and structural neuroimaging. SETTING: Hospital laboratory
	and imaging facility. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six male athletes with
	and without concussion were divided into (1) a no depression symptom,
	concussed group, (2) a mild depression symptom, concussed group,
	(3) a moderate depression symptom, concussed group, and (4) a healthy
	control group. INTERVENTIONS: All athletes filled out a postconcussive
	symptoms checklist and the Beck Depression Inventory II and underwent
	a magnetic resonance imaging session, which included T1, T2, and
	fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, as well as functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), during which they performed a
	working memory task. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Behavioral: response
	speed and accuracy on the working memory task performed during the
	fMRI session; (2) functional imaging: brain activation patterns associated
	with the working memory task obtained using blood oxygen level-dependent
	fMRI; and (3) structural imaging: voxel-based morphometry examining
	gray matter concentration. RESULTS: (1) Behavioral: there was no
	performance difference between the groups; and (2) imaging: athletes
	with concussion with depression symptoms showed reduced activation
	in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum and attenuated
	deactivation in medial frontal and temporal regions. The severity
	of symptoms of depression correlated with neural responses in brain
	areas that are implicated in major depression. Voxel-based morphometry
	confirmed gray matter loss in these areas. CONCLUSIONS: The results
	suggest that depressed mood following a concussion may reflect an
	underlying pathophysiology consistent with a limbic-frontal model
	of depression. Given that depression is associated with considerable
	functional disability, this finding has important clinical implications

	Individual case reports and group investigations from peer-reviewed
	journals were evaluated. STUDY SELECTION--Studies were included if
	they described patient behavior in detail or reported pertinent neuropsy-chological
	findings and had compelling evidence of a disorder affecting frontal-subcortical
	circuits. DATA EXTRACTION--Information was used if the report from
	which it was taken met study selection criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS--Five
	parallel segregated circuits link the frontal lobe and subcortical
	structures. Clinical syndromes observed with frontal lobe injury
	are recapitulated with lesions of subcortical member structures of
	the circuits. Each prefrontal circuit has a signature behavioral
	syndrome: executive function deficits occur with lesions of the dorsolateral
	prefrontal circuit, disinhibition with lesions of the orbitofrontal
	circuit, and apathy with injury to the anterior cingulate circuit.
	Depression, mania, and obsessive-compulsive disorder may also be
	mediated by frontal-subcotical circuits. Movement disorders identify
	involvement of the basal ganglia component of frontal-subcortical
	circuits. CONCLUSIONS--Frontal-subcortical circuits mediate many

	in some patients has been inferred from clinical observation, neuropsychological

	have yielded conflicting results and it is not possible to draw conclusions
	regarding causation, rather than merely association, from such designs.
	However, there is also evidence from in vivo biochemical studies
	that seizures may cause neuron injury. The heterogeneity of the epilepsies,
	epileptic seizures, co-morbidities, treatment regimens, and individual
	patient susceptibility all complicate the picture and inhibit the
	drawing of conclusions that are uniformly applicable. Longitudinal
	neuroimaging studies have the potential to objectively identify structural
	changes in the brain that are markers of neuronal injury. Such studies
	are a major undertaking, requiring age-matched control groups and
	consistent image acquisition and analysis techniques. One needs to
	analyze not only changes in group means but also the number of patients
	who show significant changes in imaging parameters that exceed the
	limits of test-retest reliability and changes in age-matched controls.
	Quantitative analysis of MRI T(1)-weighted volumetric datasets can
	reliably identify changes in cerebral and hippocampal volumes of
	1-3\% in individual subjects. The sensitivity of such quantitative
	analysis of structural data to identify functionally significant
	changes is not yet certain. Functional imaging techniques such as
	MR spectroscopy, PET, and SPECT may be more sensitive for detecting
	cerebral abnormalities, but their test-retest reliability is inferior.
	Other MRI tools, such as diffusion tensor imaging, may be useful
	for evaluating secondary cerebral damage after seizures, both acutely
	and chronically. Present evidence suggests that, to detect significant
	treatment effects, longitudinal studies of putative neuroprotective
	agents, using neuroimaging methods as a surrogate end point, would
	require at least a 3-year observation period, include large numbers

	the growth kinetics of this process during 24 h after trauma. Rats
	were subjected to a standardized focal freezing injury of the brain.
	Area and volume of the resulting necrosis were quantitatively assessed
	by morphometry after different periods of survival (i.e., 5 min,
	3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h after trauma). The maximal area of necrosis
	increased by 45\% (p < 0.001) during the posttraumatic observation
	period. Growth of necrosis after trauma was not limited to the early
	period, but continued between 12 and 24 h, amounting then to 29\%
	(p < 0.05). The volume of necrosis calculated on the basis of histological
	serial sections was also observed to increase by 45\%. The current
	findings confirm that a primary brain tissue lesion induced by a
	standard cryogenic injury, studied as model of a contusion focus
	in severe head injury, is subjected to secondary growth within a
	period of 24 h after trauma, longer periods of survival were not

  abstract = {Animal models have assisted in understanding the mechanisms of brain
	injury underlying cerebral palsy. Nevertheless, no such models replicate
	every aspect of the human disease. This review summarizes the classic
	and more recent studies of the neuropathology of human perinatal
	brain injury most commonly associated with cerebral palsy, for use
	by researchers and clinicians alike who need to analyze published
	animal models with respect to their fidelity to the human disorder.
	The neuropathology underlying cerebral palsy includes white-matter
	injury, known as periventricular leukomalacia, as well as germinal
	matrix hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, and injury to
	the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Each has distinctive features
	while sharing some risk factors, such as prematurity and/or hypoxia-ischemia
	in the perinatal period. Periventricular leukomalacia consists of
	diffuse injury of deep cerebral white matter, with or without focal
	necrosis. Recent work directly in human postmortem tissue has focused
	on the role of free radical injury, cytokine toxicity (especially
	in light of the epidemiologic association of periventricular leukomalacia
	with maternofetal infection), and excitotoxicity in the development
	of periventricular leukomalacia. Premyelinating oligodendrocytes,
	which predominate in periventricular regions during the window of
	vulnerability to periventricular leukomalacia (24-34 postconceptional
	weeks), are the targets of free radical injury, as determined by
	immunocytochemical markers of lipid peroxidation and protein nitration.
	This maturational susceptibility can be attributed in part to a relative
	deficiency of superoxide dismutases in developing white matter. Microglia,
	which respond to cytokines and to bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide
	via Toll-like receptors, are increased in periventricular leukomalacia
	white matter and can contribute to cellular damage. Indeed, several
	cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukins 2 and
	6, as well as interferon-g, have been demonstrated in periventricular
	leukomalacia. Preliminary work suggests a role for glutamate receptors
	and glutamate transporters in periventricular leukomalacia based
	on expression in human developing oligodendrocytes. Germinal matrix
	hemorrhage, with or without intraventricular hemorrhage, occurs in
	premature infants and can coexist with periventricular leukomalacia.
	Studies in human germinal matrix tissue have focused on maturation-based
	vascular factors, such as morphometry and expression of molecules
	related to the structure of the blood-brain barrier. Gray-matter
	injury, seen more commonly in term infants, includes cortical infarcts
	and status marmoratus. Subtle cortical injury overlying periventricular
	leukomalacia is the subject of current interest as a possible substrate
	for the cognitive difficulties seen in patients with cerebral palsy.
	In summary, it is hoped that work in human tissue, in conjunction
	with experimental animal models, will lead to eventual therapeutic
	or preventive strategies for the perinatal brain injury underlying
	cerebral palsy.},

	(VBM) is a fully automated technique that allows examination of the
	whole brain on a voxel by voxel basis. OBJECTIVE: To use VBM to evaluate
	changes in grey matter concentration following traumatic brain injury.
	METHODS: Nine patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (ranging
	from mild to severe) about one year previously were compared with
	nine age and sex matched healthy volunteers. T1 weighted three dimensional
	MRI images were acquired and then analysed with statistical parametric
	mapping software (SPM2). The patients with traumatic brain injury
	also completed cognitive testing to determine whether regional grey
	matter concentration correlated with a measure of attention and initial
	injury severity. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the brain injured
	patients had decreased grey matter concentration in multiple brain
	regions including frontal and temporal cortices, cingulate gyrus,
	subcortical grey matter, and the cerebellum. Decreased grey matter
	concentration correlated with lower scores on tests of attention
	and lower Glasgow coma scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Using VBM, regions
	of decreased grey matter concentration were observed in subjects
	with traumatic brain injury compared with well matched controls.
	In the brain injured patients, there was a relation between grey
	matter concentration and attentional ability.},

	several years giving us more information about the injury and prognosis

	others are used primarily in research but have the potential to become
	clinically useful. RECENT FINDINGS: Computed tomography (CT) scanning
	is the primary imaging technique for acute brain injury, giving rapid
	information and being part of a general trauma work up in the emergency
	situation. It has supplanted plain films in the immediate management
	of brain injury. Following stabilization, MRI is the method of choice
	for evaluating the full extent of brain injury. Information on diffuse
	axonal injury is obtained by several MRI sequences. Diffusion tensor
	imaging is able to show long tract damage and relates to prognosis.
	There are several techniques which are best suited to research in
	brain injury, including single photon emission CT, PET and xenon
	CT. SUMMARY: CT and MRI are now the imaging techniques for acute
	and subacute brain injury, respectively. Diffusion tensor imaging
	is being developed to provide more information on structural damage
	in brain injury. There are several research techniques available
	for brain injury, particularly relating to cerebral blood flow and

	the obvious lesions seen on the T2 and fluid-attenuation inversion
	recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance images in patients with chronic
	traumatic brain injury (TBI) with and without epilepsy. METHODS:
	DTI was performed on 23 chronic TBI patients (with late posttraumatic
	epilepsy, n=14; without epilepsy, n=9) and 11 age-matched controls.
	The ratios of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)
	between the regions of interest beyond the T2/FLAIR-visualized abnormality
	and the corresponding contralateral normal-appearing region were
	calculated. FA and MD ratios were compared for relative changes in
	these parameters among the TBI subjects with and without epilepsy
	and controls. Tissue volumes exhibiting abnormalities on DTI also
	were measured in these patients. RESULTS: The mean regional FA ratio
	was significantly lower, whereas the mean regional MD value was higher
	in patients with TBI compared with controls. The mean regional FA
	ratio was significantly lower in TBI patients with epilepsy (0.57+/-0.059)
	than in those without epilepsy (0.68+/-0.039). Although the regional
	MD ratio was higher in TBI patients with epilepsy (1.15+/-0.140)
	relative to those without epilepsy (1.09+/-0.141), the difference
	did not reach statistical significance. The tissue volume with low
	FA value also was found to be higher in TBI patients with epilepsy
	than without. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of injury as predicted by the
	DTI-derived increased volume of microstructure damage is associated
	with delayed posttraumatic epilepsy in TBI patients. These findings
	could be valuable in predicting epileptogenesis in patients with
	chronic TBI.},

	failure secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis. There is a complex interaction
	of these and other factors and it is difficult to dissect out the
	relative importance of each in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related
	brain damage. Moreover recent molecular and biochemical studies suggest
	that several of these factors may have pathogenetic mechanisms in
	common-for example, excitotoxicity, mitric oxide and free radicals.
	The application of new technologies in neuropathological studies
	of carefully selected groups of alcoholic cases is beginning to reveal
	a far more complex pattern of damage than current view holds. Quantitative
	morphometry and immunohistochemistry can be combined to create three
	dimensional images of various anatomical regions of the brain together

  abstract = {THALAMUS: The human thalamus is a nuclear complex located in the diencephalon
	and comprising of four parts (the hypothalamus, the epythalamus,
	the ventral thalamus, and the dorsal thalamus). The thalamus is a
	relay centre subserving both sensory and motor mechanisms. Thalamic
	nuclei (50-60 nuclei) project to one or a few well-defined cortical
	areas. Multiple cortical areas receive afferents from a single thalamic
	nucleus and send back information to different thalamic nuclei. The
	corticofugal projection provides positive feedback to the "correct"
	input, while at the same time suppressing irrelevant information.
	Topographical organisation of the thalamic afferents and efferents
	is contralateral, and the lateralisation of the thalamic functions
	affects both sensory and motoric aspects. Symptoms of lesions located
	in the thalamus are closely related to the function of the areas
	involved. An infarction or haemorrhage thalamic lesion can develop
	somatosensory disturbances and/or central pain in the opposite hemibody,
	analgesic or purely algesic thalamic syndrome characterised by contralateral
	anaesthesia (or hypaesthesia), contralateral weakness, ataxia and,
	often, persistent spontaneous pain. BASAL GANGLIA: Basal ganglia
	form a major centre in the complex extrapyramidal motor system, as
	opposed to the pyramidal motor system (corticobulbar and corticospinal
	pathways). Basal ganglia are involved in many neuronal pathways having
	emotional, motivational, associative and cognitive functions as well.
	The striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens) receive
	inputs from all cortical areas and, throughout the thalamus, project
	principally to frontal lobe areas (prefrontal, premotor and supplementary
	motor areas) which are concerned with motor planning. These circuits:
	(i) have an important regulatory influence on cortex, providing information
	for both automatic and voluntary motor responses to the pyramidal
	system; (ii) play a role in predicting future events, reinforcing
	wanted behaviour and suppressing unwanted behaviour, and (iii) are
	involved in shifting attentional sets and in both high-order processes
	of movement initiation and spatial working memory. Basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical
	circuits maintain somatotopic organisation of movement-related neurons
	throughout the circuit. These circuits reveal functional subdivisions
	of the oculomotor, prefrontal and cingulate circuits, which play
	an important role in attention, learning and potentiating behaviour-guiding
	rules. Involvement of the basal ganglia is related to involuntary
	and stereotyped movements or paucity of movements without involvement
	of voluntary motor functions, as in Parkinson's disease, Wilson's
	disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or Huntington's disease.
	The symptoms differ with the location of the lesion. The commonest
	disturbances in basal ganglia lesions are abulia (apathy with loss
	of initiative and of spontaneous thought and emotional responses)
	and dystonia, which become manifest as behavioural and motor disturbances,
	respectively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important medical concern of the Iraq war is the potential
	long-term effect of mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion, particularly
	from blast explosions. However, the epidemiology of combat-related
	mild traumatic brain injury is poorly understood. METHODS: We surveyed
	2525 U.S. Army infantry soldiers 3 to 4 months after their return
	from a year-long deployment to Iraq. Validated clinical instruments
	were used to compare soldiers reporting mild traumatic brain injury,
	defined as an injury with loss of consciousness or altered mental
	status (e.g., dazed or confused), with soldiers who reported other
	injuries. RESULTS: Of 2525 soldiers, 124 (4.9\%) reported injuries
	with loss of consciousness, 260 (10.3\%) reported injuries with altered
	mental status, and 435 (17.2\%) reported other injuries during deployment.
	Of those reporting loss of consciousness, 43.9\% met criteria for
	post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as compared with 27.3\% of
	those reporting altered mental status, 16.2\% with other injuries,
	and 9.1\% with no injury. Soldiers with mild traumatic brain injury,
	primarily those who had loss of consciousness, were significantly
	more likely to report poor general health, missed workdays, medical
	visits, and a high number of somatic and postconcussive symptoms
	than were soldiers with other injuries. However, after adjustment
	for PTSD and depression, mild traumatic brain injury was no longer
	significantly associated with these physical health outcomes or symptoms,
	except for headache. CONCLUSIONS: Mild traumatic brain injury (i.e.,
	concussion) occurring among soldiers deployed in Iraq is strongly
	associated with PTSD and physical health problems 3 to 4 months after
	the soldiers return home. PTSD and depression are important mediators
	of the relationship between mild traumatic brain injury and physical
	health problems.},

	Few are satisfactory. CT and conventional MR imaging underestimate

	including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can provide information
	about brain ultrastructure by quantifying isotropic and anisotropic
	water diffusion. Our objective was to determine if changes in anisotropic
	diffusion in TBI correlate with acute Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and/or
	Rankin scores at discharge. METHODS: Twenty patients (15 male, five
	Female; mean age, 31 years) were evaluated. Apparent diffusion coefficients
	(ADCs) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured at multiple
	locations and correlated with clinical scores. Results were compared
	with those of 15 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: ADC values were
	significantly reduced within the splenium (Delta18\%, P =.001). FA
	values were significantly reduced in the internal capsule (Delta14\%;
	P <.001) and splenium (Delta16\%; P =.002). FA values were significantly
	correlated with GCS (r = 0.65-0.74; P <.001) and Rankin (r = 0.68-0.71;
	P <.001) scores for the internal capsule and splenium. The correlation
	between FA and clinical markers was better than for the corresponding
	ADC values. No correlation was found between ADC of the internal
	capsule and GCS/Rankin scores. CONCLUSION: DTI reveals changes in
	the white matter that are correlated with both acute GCS and Rankin
	scores at discharge. DTI may be a valuable biomarker for the severity

	all sequences. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-seven lesions were counted
	by the combined use of all sequences. DWI identified 70 lesions not
	seen on conventional MRI. DWI identified 310 shearing injuries, followed
	by T2/FLAIR (n = 248) and T2* (n = 202). The majority of DWI-positive
	lesions showed decreased diffusion (65\%). CONCLUSION: DWI is valuable
	in closed head injury because it identifies additional shearing injuries
	not visible on T2/FLAIR or T2* sequences. Furthermore, DWI/ADC maps
	differentiate between lesions with decreased or increased diffusion.
	DWI is less sensitive than T2* imaging for detecting hemorrhagic

	brain injury (TBI) that leads to functional and psychological deficits.
	Although DAI is frequently underdiagnosed by conventional imaging
	modalities, it can be demonstrated using diffusion tensor imaging.
	The aim of this study was to assess the presence and extent of DAI
	in patients with mild TBI. METHODS: Forty-six patients with mild
	TBI and 29 healthy volunteers underwent a magnetic resonance (MR)
	imaging protocol including: dual-spin echo, fluid-attenuated inversion
	recovery, T2-weighted gradient echo, and diffusion tensor imaging
	sequences. In 20 of the patients, MR imaging was performed at a mean
	of 4.05 days after injury. In the remaining 26, MR imaging was performed
	at a mean of 5.7 years after injury. In each case, mean diffusivity
	and fractional anisotropy were measured using both whole-brain histograms
	and regions of interest analysis. No differences in any of the histogram-derived
	measures were found between patients and control volunteers. Compared
	with controls, a significant reduction of fractional anisotropy was
	observed in patients' corpus callosum, internal capsule, and centrum
	semiovale, and there were significant increases of mean diffusivity
	in the corpus callosum and internal capsule. Neither histogram-derived
	nor regional diffusion tensor imaging metrics differed between the
	two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although mean diffusivity and fractional
	anisotropy abnormalities in these patients with TBI were too subtle
	to be detected with the whole-brain histogram analysis, they are
	present in brain areas that are frequent sites of DAI. Because diffusion
	tensor imaging changes are present at both early and late time points
	following injury, they may represent an early indicator and a prognostic
	measure of subsequent brain damage.},

	traumatic brain injury in humans, and its evolution in the acute
	phase, remain unresolved. This study aimed to characterize the topographical
	nature of the pathophysiological changes in human traumatic brain
	injury with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS:
	Multislice diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were
	acquired from five patients undergoing elective ventilation for management
	of traumatic focal contusion or hematomas. The diffusion tensor and
	the T2-weighted intensity were then computed for every voxel in the
	image data set for each patient. The topographical distribution of
	abnormalities in the trace of the diffusion tensor and T2-weighted
	images were characterized by cluster analysis. RESULTS: In four patients
	with technically satisfactory data, a narrow band of tissue was observed
	in the periphery of focal lesions, which was characterized by selective
	reduction in the trace of the diffusion tensor, without any associated
	increase in the T2-weighted signal intensity. CONCLUSION: This change
	is interpreted as indicating either a partial redistribution of water
	from the extra- to intracellular compartment, or a reduction in the
	diffusivity of water in the intracellular or cytosolic environment.
	These diffusion and T2-weighted characteristics are also found in
	early ischemic change, hence, such regions may represent potentially
	salvageable tissue at risk of permanent damage. The study illustrates
	the advantage of using information contained within the diffusion
	tensor in addition to more conventional imaging sequences.},

	was also associated with poorer social functioning at the 6-and 12-month
	follow-up, as well as significantly reduced left prefrontal gray
	matter volumes, particularly in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral
	regions. CONCLUSIONS: Major depression is a frequent complication
	of TBI that hinders a patient's recovery. It is associated with executive
	dysfunction, negative affect, and prominent anxiety symptoms. The
	neuropathological changes produced by TBI may lead to deactivation
	of lateral and dorsal prefrontal cortices and increased activation
	of ventral limbic and paralimbic structures including the amygdala.},

	resonance images were obtained in 21 patients with Alzheimer disease,
	19 patients with MCI, and 55 normally aging elderly control subjects
	without evidence of cognitive impairment. Regions of interest were
	drawn to compare the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the
	anisotropy index (AI) in frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital,
	anterior, and posterior cingulate white matter (WM), and the thalami
	and hippocampi. RESULTS: Hippocampal ADC was higher in MCI and Alzheimer
	disease patients than in control subjects. ADC of the temporal stem
	and posterior cingulate, occipital, and parietal WM was higher in
	Alzheimer disease patients than in control subjects. Except for occipital
	AI, which was lower in MCI patients than in control subjects, there
	were no differences in AI among the three groups for any of the regions.
	CONCLUSION: Hippocampal ADC was significantly different between control

	This study aimed to investigate the value of early magnetic resonance

	in the clinically relevant model of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE).
	Moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) was induced by lateral fluid-percussion
	in two groups of adult rats (34 injured, 16 controls). In Experiment
	1, MRI follow-up was performed using a 4.7 T magnet at 3 h, 3 days,
	9 days, 23 days, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months after TBI. T2 and
	1/3 of the trace of the diffusion tensor (D(av)) were quantified
	from a single slice using a fast spin-echo sequence. In Experiment
	2, MRI was performed at 7 and 11 months post-injury. In both groups,
	seizure susceptibility was tested by injecting a single dose of pentylenetetrazol
	at 12 months post-injury. Electrographic and behavioural responses
	were monitored for 1 h. Total number of spikes, total number of epileptiform
	discharges (EDs) and latency to first spike were measured. Finally,
	the severity of mossy fibre sprouting was evaluated. In both experiments,
	EEG parameters such as total number of spikes or EDs proved to be
	reliable indicators of increased seizure susceptibility in injured
	animals when compared to controls (P < 0.05). In the hippocampus
	ipsilateral to TBI, D(av) correlated with these EEG parameters at
	both early (3 h), and chronic (23 days, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 11 months)
	time points after TBI, as well as with the density of mossy fibre
	sprouting. These results for the first time demonstrate that quantitative

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem. Even
	injuries classified as mild, the most common, can result in persistent
	neurobehavioural impairment. Diffuse axonal injury is a common finding
	after TBI, and is presumed to contribute to outcomes, but may not
	always be apparent using standard neuroimaging. Diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) is a more recent method of assessing axonal integrity
	in vivo. The primary objective of the current investigation was to
	characterize white matter integrity utilizing DTI across the spectrum
	of chronic TBI of all severities. A secondary objective was to examine
	the relationship between white matter integrity and cognition. Twenty
	mild, 17 moderate to severe TBI and 18 controls underwent DTI and
	neuropsychological testing. Fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity
	and radial diffusivity were calculated from the DTI data. Fractional
	anisotropy was the primary measure of white matter integrity. Region
	of interest analysis included anterior and posterior corona radiata,
	cortico-spinal tracts, cingulum fibre bundles, external capsule,
	forceps minor and major, genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum,
	inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus
	and sagittal stratum. Cognitive domain scores were calculated from
	executive, attention and memory testing. Decreased fractional anisotropy
	was found in all 13 regions of interest for the moderate to severe
	TBI group, but only in the cortico-spinal tract, sagittal stratum
	and superior longitudinal fasciculus for the mild TBI group. White
	Matter Load (a measure of the total number of regions with reduced
	FA) was negatively correlated with all cognitive domains. Analysis
	of radial and axial diffusivity values suggested that all severities
	of TBI can result in a degree of axonal damage, while irreversible
	myelin damage was only apparent for moderate to severe TBI. The present
	data emphasize that white matter changes exist on a spectrum, including
	mild TBI. An index of global white matter neuropathology (White Matter
	Load) was related to cognitive function, such that greater white
	matter pathology predicted greater cognitive deficits. Mechanistically,
	mild TBI white matter changes may be primarily due to axonal damage
	as opposed to myelin damage. The more severe injuries impact both.
	DTI provides an objective means for determining the relationship
	of cognitive deficits to TBI, even in cases where the injury was
	sustained years prior to the evaluation.},

	Quantitative DTI parameters, including apparent diffusion coefficient

	magnetic resonance images revealed findings of diffuse axonal injury,
	including a lesion at the midline of the splenium of the corpus callosum.
	DTI performed 3 days posttrauma revealed that the splenial lesion
	had reduced apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy,
	reflecting a large decrease in the magnitude of diffusion parallel
	to the white matter fibers, which had partially recovered as revealed
	by follow-up DTI 12 weeks postinjury. 3-D tractography revealed an
	interruption of the white matter fibers in the posteroinferior aspect

	a functional deficit caused by disconnection of the right visual

	development of CC through the second decade, serial MRI could characterize
	effects of CHI on CC growth in children. METHOD: MRI performed at
	3 and 36 months after severe (mean age = 10.3 years, n = 25) and
	mild to moderate (mean age = 9.7 years, n = 28) CHI. Mild to moderate
	and severe CHI groups did not differ in demographic features. Morphometry
	of T1-weighted midsagittal CC by two operators with satisfactory
	interrater reliability yielded uncorrected and corrected CC volume.
	RESULTS: An interaction of occasion with CHI severity was present
	as CC area decreased from 3 to 36 months in severely injured children
	and increased in the mild to moderate CHI group. Uncorrected CC area
	was correlated with acute CHI severity and functional outcome at
	36 months postinjury. CONCLUSIONS: Morphometric measurement of CC
	area provides a useful index of diffuse injury, which is related
	to functional outcome of CHI in children.},

  abstract = {We should like to emphasize the following points: 1. Apathy is defined
	here as a quantified and observable behavioral syndrome consisting
	in a quantitative reduction of voluntary (or goal-directed) behaviors;
	2. Therefore, apathy occurs when the systems that generate and control
	voluntary actions are altered; 3. These systems are mostly represented
	by the different subregions embedded in the Prefrontal cortex (PFC)
	and in the basal ganglia regions that are closely connected with
	the PFC; 4. In consequence, clinically, apathy is a prefrontal syndrome
	either due to direct lesions of the PFC or to lesions of basal ganglia
	areas that are closely related to the PFC; 5. Apathy is not a single
	entity but rather heterogeneous. Several different mechanisms may
	lead to apathy; Because there are several anatomical-functional prefrontal-basal
	ganglia circuits, the underlying mechanisms responsible for apathy
	may differ according to which prefrontal-basal ganglia circuit is
	affected; 6. In this context, apathy is the macroscopic results of
	the disruption of one or several elementary steps necessary for goal-directed
	behavior that are subserved by different prefrontal-basal ganglia
	circuits; 7. Intense apathy is related to caudate nucleus and GPi,
	disrupting associative and limbic pathways from/to the PFC; 8. in
	progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and focal lesions (caudate nuclei,
	GPi), apathy may be due to a loss of PFC activation; 9. In Parkinson's
	disease (PD), apathy may be due to a loss of signal focalization;
	10. More globally, we propose that apathy may be explained by the
	impact of lesions or dysfunctions of the BG, because these lesions
	or dysfunctions lead to a loss of amplification of the relevant signal
	and/or to a loss of temporal and spatial focalization, both of which
	result in a diminished extraction of the relevant signal within the
	frontal cortex, thereby inhibiting the capacity of the frontal cortex
	to select, initiate, maintain and shift programs of action.},

  abstract = {The clinical signs grouped under the concept of apathy are a common
	feature of prefrontal and basal ganglia lesions or dysfunctions and
	can therefore help to improve our understanding of the functional
	anatomy of the prefrontal-basal ganglia system. Apathy is here defined
	as a quantitative reduction of voluntary, goal-directed behaviors.
	The underlying mechanisms responsible for apathy can be divided into
	three subtypes of disrupted processing: 'emotional-affective', 'cognitive'
	and 'auto-activation'. Apathy due to the disruption of 'emotional-affective'
	processing refers to the inability to establish the necessary linkage
	between emotional-affective signals and the ongoing or forthcoming
	behavior. It may be related to lesions of the orbital-medial prefrontal
	cortex or to the related subregions (limbic territory) within the
	basal ganglia (e.g. ventral striatum, ventral pallidum). Apathy due
	to the disruption of 'cognitive' processing refers to difficulties
	in elaborating the plan of actions necessary for the ongoing or forthcoming
	behavior. It may be related to lesions of the dorsolateral prefrontal
	cortex and the related subregions (associative territory) within
	the basal ganglia (e.g. dorsal caudate nucleus). The disruption of
	'auto-activation' processing refers to the inability to self-activate
	thoughts or self-initiate actions contrasting with a relatively spared
	ability to generate externally driven behavior. It is responsible
	for the most severe form of apathy and in most cases the lesions
	affect bilaterally the associative and limbic territories of the
	internal portion of the globus pallidus. It characterizes the syndrome
	of 'auto-activation deficit' (also known as 'psychic akinesia' or
	'athymormia'). This syndrome implies that direct lesions of the basal
	ganglia output result in a loss of amplification of the relevant
	signal, consequently leading to a diminished extraction of this signal
	within the frontal cortex. Likewise, apathy occurring in Parkinson's
	disease could be interpreted as secondary to the loss of spatial
	and temporal focalization of the signals transferred to the frontal
	cortex. In both situations (direct basal ganglia lesions and nigro-striatal
	dopaminergic loss), the capacity of the frontal cortex to select,
	initiate, maintain and shift programs of actions is impaired.},

	0.05). Contralaterally, the neocortex did not change in volume, whereas
	the thalamus tended to be smaller by a mean of 11.1\%. Ipsilaterally,
	in all four thalamic nuclei studied, the neuronal and glial cell
	packing densities (NCPD and GCPD) and the cross sectional area of
	neuronal somata did not differ between lesioned and intact animals

	the first week of life. Regions of injury were determined by evaluating
	conventional MR images (T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)

	infants 1 day after injury, but injury was not evident or underestimated
	in 4 of 10 infants despite the presence of injury on conventional
	imaging at 1 week. By the third day, D(av) values were decreased

	values were returning to normal (pseudonormalization). CONCLUSIONS:
	MR diffusion images (for which contrast is determined by changes
	in D(av)) obtained on the first day after injury do not necessarily
	show the full extent of ultimate injury in newborn infants. Images
	obtained between the second and fourth days of life reliably indicate
	the extent of injury. By the seventh day, diffusion MR is less sensitive
	to perinatal brain injury than conventional MR because of transient

	expression, hypertrophy and proliferation that occur in a gradated
	fashion in relation to the severity of the injury. Both beneficial
	and detrimental effects have been attributed to reactive astrocytes,
	but their roles after brain injury are not well understood. To investigate
	these roles, we determined the effects on cortical tissue of ablating
	reactive astrocytes after contusion injury generated by controlled
	cortical impact (CCI) of different severities in transgenic mice
	that express a glial fibrillary acidic protein-herpes simplex virus-thymidine
	kinase transgene. Treatment of these mice with the antiviral agent,
	ganciclovir, conditionally ablates proliferating reactive astrocytes.
	Moderate or severe CCI were generated with a precisely regulated
	pneumatic piston, and forebrain tissue was evaluated using immunohistochemistry
	and quantitative morphometry. Moderate CCI in control mice triggered
	extensive and persisting reactive astrogliosis, with most neurons
	being preserved, little inflammation and an 18\% loss of cortical
	tissue beneath the impact site. Ablation of reactive astrocytes after
	moderate CCI in transgenic mice caused substantial neuronal degeneration
	and inflammation, with a significantly greater 60\% loss of cortical
	tissue. Severe CCI in control mice caused pronounced neuronal degeneration
	and loss of about 88\% of cortical tissue that was not significantly
	altered by ablating reactive astrocytes in transgenic mice. Thus,
	ablation of dividing reactive astrocytes exacerbated cortical degeneration
	after moderate CCI, but did not alter cortical degeneration after
	severe CCI. These findings indicate that the reactive astrocytes
	play essential roles in preserving neural tissue and restricting
	inflammation after moderate focal brain injury.},

	in patients with nmTBI with cognitive impairments using diffusion
	tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI). METHODS: DTI scans of healthy
	controls were compared with those of 23 patients with nmTBI who manifested
	cognitive impairments but no obvious neuroradiological lesions. DTI
	was comprised of fractional anisotropy analysis, which included voxel-based
	analysis and confirmatory study using regions of interest (ROI) techniques,
	and magnetic resonance tractography of the corpus callosum and fornix.
	RESULTS: A decline in fractional anisotropy around the genu, stem
	and splenium of the corpus callosum was shown by voxel-based analysis.
	Fractional anisotropy values of the genu (0.47), stem (0.48), and
	splenium of the corpus callosum (0.52), and the column of the fornix
	(0.51) were lower in patients with nmTBI than in healthy controls
	(0.58, 0.61, 0.62 and 0.61, respectively) according to the confirmatory
	study of ROIs. The white matter architecture in the corpus callosum
	and fornix of patients with nmTBI were seen to be coarser than in
	the controls in the individual magnetic resonance tractography. CONCLUSIONS:
	Disruption of the corpus callosum and fornix in patients with nmTBI
	without macroscopically detectable lesions is shown. DTI is sensitive
	enough to detect abnormal neural fibres related to cognitive dysfunction

	and morbidity following traumatic brain injury (TBI), but is poorly
	characterized by conventional imaging techniques. Diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) may provide better detection as well as insights into
	the mechanisms of white matter injury. DTI data from 33 patients

	burden of whole brain white matter injury (GB(WMI)) was quantified
	by measuring the proportion of voxels that lay below a critical fractional
	anisotropy (FA) threshold, identified from control data. Mechanisms
	of change in FA maps were explored using an Eigenvalue analysis of
	the diffusion tensor. When compared with controls, patients showed
	significantly reduced mean FA (p < 0.001) and increased apparent
	diffusion coefficient (ADC; p = 0.017). GB(WMI) was significantly
	greater in patients than in controls (p < 0.01), but did not distinguish
	patients with obvious white matter lesions seen on structural imaging.
	It predicted classification of DTI images as head injury with a high
	degree of accuracy. Eigenvalue analysis showed that reductions in
	FA were predominantly the result of increases in radial diffusivity
	(p < 0.001). DTI may help quantify the overall burden of white matter
	injury in TBI and provide insights into underlying pathophysiology.
	Eigenvalue analysis suggests that the early imaging changes seen
	in white matter are consistent with axonal swelling rather than axonal
	truncation. This technique holds promise for examining disease progression,

	Eighteen CADASIL subjects underwent DTI and cognitive assessment,

	also performed on 12 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: Mean
	diffusivity was increased in white matter lesions, normal-appearing
	white matter, and normal-appearing gray matter (thalamus, putamen,
	and globus pallidus). A composite score of executive function correlated
	with diffusivity in both normal-appearing gray matter (r = -0.73,

	volumes. Correlations with MMSE were much weaker, and there was no
	correlation between T2 lesion volume and the executive function score

	abnormality in head trauma and is characterized by reduction of fractional
	anisotropy (FA) on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Our hypothesis
	was that patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) have widespread
	brain white matter regions of reduced FA involving a variety of fiber
	bundles and show fiber disruption on fiber tracking in a minority
	of these regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval
	and informed consent were obtained. Twenty-one patients with mild
	TBI were investigated (men:women, 12:9; mean age +/- SD, 32 +/- 9
	years). In a voxel-based comparison with 11 control subjects (men:women,
	8:3; mean age, 37 +/- 9 years) using z score analysis, patient regions
	with abnormally reduced FA were defined in brain white matter. MR
	imaging, DTI, and fiber tracking characteristics of these regions
	were described and analyzed using Pearson correlation, linear regression
	analysis, or the chi(2) test when appropriate. RESULTS: Patients
	had on average 9.1 regions with reduced FA, with a mean region volume
	of 525 mm(3), predominantly found in cerebral lobar white matter,
	cingulum, and corpus callosum. These regions mainly involved supratentorial
	projection fiber bundles, callosal fibers, and fronto-temporo-occipital
	association fiber bundles. Internal capsules and infratentorial white
	matter were relatively infrequently affected. Of all of the involved
	fiber bundles, 19.3\% showed discontinuity on fiber tracking. CONCLUSION:
	Patients with mild TBI have multiple regions with reduced FA in various
	white matter locations and involving various fiber bundles. A minority
	of these fiber bundles show discontinuity on fiber tracking.},

	in MCS for 6 yr following traumatic brain injury before the intervention.
	The frequency of specific cognitively mediated behaviours (primary

	compared with periods in which it was off. Logistic regression modelling
	shows a statistical linkage between the observed functional improvements

	for a loss of arousal regulation that is normally controlled by the
	frontal lobe in the intact brain. These findings provide evidence

	there is a lack of longitudinal studies on TBI that follow DTI changes
	over time and correlate findings with long-term clinical outcome.
	We performed a prospective longitudinal study of 30 adult patients
	admitted for subacute rehabilitation following severe traumatic brain
	injury. DTI and conventional MRI were acquired at mean 8 weeks (5-11
	weeks), and repeated in 23 of the patients at mean 12 months (9-15
	months) post-trauma. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, DTI
	parameters were compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned
	during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval
	as that of patients. At the initial scan, fractional anisotropy was
	reduced in all the investigated white matter regions in patients
	compared to controls (P <or= 0.01) due to decreased diffusivity parallel
	(lambda(parallel)) and increased diffusivity perpendicular (lambda(perpendicular))
	to axonal fibre direction. Fractional anisotropy in the cerebral
	peduncle correlated with approximately 1 year Glasgow outcome scale
	score (r = 0.60, P<0.001) and in this sample predicted dichotomized
	outcome with 76\% accuracy when taken alone, and with 100\% accuracy
	in combination with clinical evaluation by functional independence
	measure at the time of the first scan. At follow-up DTI, fractional
	anisotropy in patients had increased in the internal capsule and
	in centrum semiovale (P <or= 0.01) due to an interval increase of
	lambda(parallel) with unchanged lambda(perpendicular). In these regions,
	fractional anisotropy and lambda( parallel) reached normal or supranormal
	levels, primarily in patients with favourable outcome. In the cerebral
	peduncle and in corpus callosum, lambda(parallel) and lambda(perpendicular)
	both increased during the scan interval and, particularly in patients
	with unfavourable outcome, fractional anisotropy remained depressed.
	No significant DTI parameter changes over time were found in controls,

	might serve as a tool for revealing changes in the neural tissue

  abstract = {Myelin loss and axonal damage are both observed in white matter injuries.
	Each may have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients.
	Currently, there does not exist a noninvasive biological marker that
	enables differentiation between myelin and axonal injury. We describe
	herein the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	to quantify the effect of dysmyelination on water directional diffusivities
	in brains of shiverer mice in vivo. The principal diffusion eigenvalues
	of eight axonal fiber tracts that can be identified with certainty
	on DTI maps were measured. The water diffusivity perpendicular to
	axonal fiber tracts, lambda(perpendicular), was significantly higher
	in shiverer mice compared with age-matched controls, reflecting the
	lack of myelin and the increased freedom of cross-fiber diffusion
	in white matter. The water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber tracts,
	lambda(parallel), was not different, which is consistent with the
	presence of intact axons. It is clear that dysmyelination alone does
	not impact lambda(parallel). The presence of intact axons in the
	setting of incomplete myelination was confirmed by electron microscopy.
	Although further validation is still needed, our finding suggests
	that changes in lambda(perpendicular) and lambda(parallel) may potentially
	be used to differentiate myelin loss versus axonal injury.},

	disorders that restricted their activities of daily living. In both
	patients, DTI fiber tractography revealed interruption of the white
	matter fibers in the corpus collosum and the fornix, while no lesions
	were found on conventional MRI. The interruption of the fornix which
	involves the circuit of Papez potentially correlates with the memory

	the presence of axonal injury in multiple white matter tracts of

	technique, can observe water molecule diffusion non-invasively at
	molecular level. This study was to assess diagnostic value of DTI
	on post-radiotherapy brain injury by quantitatively analyzing diffuse
	features of water in bilateral temporal lobes alba of those nasopharyngeal
	carcinoma (NPC) patients with normal conventional MRI performances.
	METHODS: DTI was performed in 13 NPC patients with normal conventional
	MRI performances after radiotherapy, and 21 healthy controls. Isotropic
	apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCiso) and anisotropic index (AI)
	were measured in bilateral temporal lobes alba. RESULTS: ADCiso of
	patient group was (631.30+/-27.83) x 10(-6) mm2/s, while that of
	control group was (651.76+/-39.10) x 10(-6) mm2/s (P>0.05). Temporal
	lobes diffusion AI decreased significantly in patient group, mean
	fractional anisotropy (FA) was 0.405+/-0.042, mean relative anisotropy
	(RA) was 0.355+/-0.044, and mean 1 minus volume ratio (1-VR) was
	0.192+/-0.042; while those in control group were 0.463+/-0.047, 0.418+/-0.052,
	and 0.257+/-0.055, respectively (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: DTI can early
	detect subtle alba changes in NPC patients after radiotherapy, which
	conventional MRI failed to sense. AI is more sensitive than ADCiso,
	may better describe the diffuse features of water molecules, and
	evaluate the temporal lobes alba changes before and after NPC radiotherapy.},

	The objectives of this study were to determine features of anthropometry

	whether hippocampal volume is related to severity of initial ictus
	and changes in white matter at follow-up. Thirty-three patients underwent
	magnetic resonance imaging 4.9 y after severe TBI that necessitated
	intensive care; 23 had mechanical ventilation and intracranial pressure
	monitoring longer than 3 d. Magnetic resonance imaging analyses included
	volume of brain, hemisphere, ventricles, and hippocampal and perihippocampal
	regions; spatial distribution of voxel-based morphometry differences
	in white matter; and eigenvalues of diffusion tensor imaging diffusivity.
	Patients with longer intensive care ictus had smaller-than-expected
	occipitofrontal head circumference. Eight of these, identified by
	voxel-based morphometry, had periventricular white matter loss and
	smaller-than-expected brain volume for OFC, suggesting "atrophy";
	the remainder had expected volume for a smaller OFC, suggesting "growth
	disturbance." Ninety-three percent of the variation in right hippocampal
	volume was accounted for by factors related to severity of injury
	and white matter atrophy. It is concluded that anthropometry and
	cerebral morphometric measurements late after severe TBI in childhood
	provides useful outcome data and indicate that, despite adequate
	growth in stature, effects of TBI on brain growth and hippocampal

	brain injury (nmTBI) without obvious neuroradiological lesions was
	examined and the volumes of these structures were correlated with

	length of coma from the selected anatomical volumes was examined.
	METHOD: High spatial resolution T1 weighted MRI scans of the brain
	(1 mm3) and neuropsychological evaluations with standardised tests
	were performed at least 3 months after trauma in 19 patients. RESULTS:
	In comparison with control subjects matched in terms of gender and
	age, volume reduction in the hippocampus, fornix, and corpus callosum
	of the nmTBI patients was quantitatively significant. The length
	of coma correlated with the volume reduction in the corpus callosum.
	Immediate free recall of word lists correlated with the volume of
	the fornix and the corpus callosum. Delayed recall of word lists
	and immediate recall of the Rey figure both correlated with the volume
	of the fornix. Delayed recall of the Rey figure correlated with the
	volume of the fornix and the right hippocampus. CONCLUSION: These
	findings demonstrate that in severe nmTBI without obvious neuroradiological
	lesions there is a clear hippocampal, fornix, and callosal volume
	reduction. The length of coma predicts the callosal volume reduction,
	which could be considered a marker of the severity of axonal loss.
	A few memory test scores correlated with the volumes of the selected
	anatomical structures. This relationship with memory performance
	may reflect the diffuse nature of the damage, leading to the disruption
	of neural circuits at multiple levels and the progressive neural
	degeneration occurring in TBI.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recovery from focal motor pathway lesions may be associated
	with a functional reorganisation of cortical motor areas. Previous
	studies of the relation between structural brain damage and the functional
	consequences have employed MRI and CT, which provide limited structural
	information. The recent development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	now provides quantitative measures of fibre tract integrity and orientation.
	The objective was to use DTI and functional MRI (fMRI) to determine
	the mechanisms underlying the excellent recovery found after a penetrating
	injury to the right capsular region. METHODS: DTI and fMRI were performed
	on the patient described; DTI was performed on five normal controls.
	RESULTS: The injury resulted in a left hemiplegia which resolved
	fully over several weeks. When studied 18 months later there was
	no pyramidal weakness, a mild hemidystonia, and sensory disturbance.
	fMRI activation maps showed contralateral primary and supplementary
	motor cortex activation during tapping of each hand; smaller ipsilateral
	primary motor areas were activated by the recovered hand only. DTI
	disclosed preserved structural integrity and orientation in the posterior
	capsular limb by contrast with the disrupted structure in the anterior
	limb on the injured side. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that
	the main recovery mechanism was a preservation of the integrity and
	orientation of pyramidal tract fibres. The fMRI studies do not suggest
	substantial reorganisation of the motor cortex, although ipsilateral
	pathways may have contributed to the recovery. The initial deficit
	was probably due to reversible local factors including oedema and
	mass effect; permanent damage to fibre tracts in the anterior capsular
	limb may account for the persistent sensory deficit. This study shows
	for the first time the potential value of combining fMRI and DTI
	together to investigate mechanisms of recovery and persistent deficit
	in an individual patient.},

	callosum atrophy, we hypothesized that anterior commissure volume
	(using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in this structure
	would be decreased in children with moderate to severe traumatic
	brain injury relative to typically developing children. Second, given
	the purported role of the anterior commissure in interhemispheric
	axon conveyance between temporal lobes, we hypothesized that temporal
	lobe white matter, temporal lesion volume, and injury severity (Glasgow
	Coma Scale score) would be predictive of decreased anterior commissure
	cross-sectional volume in patients with traumatic brain injury. Finally,
	we wished to establish the relationship between the anterior commissure
	and the temporal stem, a major white-matter tract into the temporal
	lobes, using diffusion tensor imaging fiber-tracking maps for each
	patient. We also hypothesized that children with traumatic brain
	injury would exhibit decreased fractional anisotropy in relation
	to typically developing children in a fiber system including the
	anterior commissure and the temporal lobes. Decreased anterior commissure
	cross-sectional volume was observed in patients with traumatic brain
	injury, and, as predicted, anterior commissure and temporal white-matter
	volumes were positively related to each other and to higher Glasgow
	Coma Scale scores. Lesion volume was not independently predictive
	of anterior commissure volume in the overall model. Diffusion tensor
	imaging fractional anisotropy values differed between the groups
	for the temporal stem-anterior commissure system, with the traumatic
	brain injury group exhibiting decreased fractional anisotropy. The
	anterior commissure, like the corpus callosum, appears to be highly
	vulnerable to white-matter degenerative changes resulting from mechanisms
	such as the direct impact of trauma, progressive axonal injury as

	This is the first systematic examination of anterior commissure atrophy

	was to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers
	additional information as to the extent of damage not visualized
	with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with severe
	TBI. Nine chronic male TBI patients and 11 matched healthy controls

	tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), internal and external
	capsule, superior and inferior longitudinal fascicles, and the fornix
	in the TBI group. The FA and ADC measurements offered superior sensitivity
	compared to conventional MRI diagnosis of DAI. Region-of-interest
	(ROI) analyses confirmed these results in the investigated regions.
	The findings of this study support the hypothesis that severe TBI
	is accompanied by DAI. The DTI changes were more prominent on the

	The lowest value of \%FA for each of the six ROIs in each CST was

	strength that produced MEP was defined as the minimum threshold for
	MEP. The mean minimum \%FA for CSTs in which MEP could not be obtained
	even with maximum magnetic stimulation (the MEP- group) was significantly
	lower than that of CSTs in which MEP could be obtained (the MEP+
	group). ROIs with the lowest \%FA value were the midbrain in the

	quantify white matter (WM) integrity. Although its application in
	adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common, few studies in children
	have been reported. The purposes of this study were to examine the
	alteration of fractional anisotropy (FA) in children with TBI experienced
	during early childhood and to quantify the association between FA
	and injury severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FA was assessed in 9
	children with TBI (age = 7.89 +/- 1.00 years; Glasgow Coma Scale
	[GCS] = 10.11 +/- 4.68) and a control group of 12 children with orthopedic
	injuries without central nervous system involvement (age = 7.51 +/-
	0.95 years). All of the subjects were at minimum 12 months after
	injury. We examined group differences in a series of predetermined
	WM regions of interest with t test analysis. We subsequently conducted
	a voxel-wise comparison with Spearman partial correlation analysis.
	Correlations between FA and injury severity were also calculated
	on a voxel-wise basis. RESULTS: FA values were significantly reduced
	in the TBI group in genu of corpus callosum (CC), posterior limb
	of internal capsule (PLIC), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF),
	superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFO), and centrum semiovale
	(CS). GCS scores were positively correlated with FA in several WM
	areas including CC, PLIC, SLF, CS, SFO, and inferior fronto-occipital
	fasciculus (IFO). CONCLUSION: This DTI study provides evidence that
	WM integrity remains abnormal in children with moderate-to-severe
