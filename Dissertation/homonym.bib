  abstract = {Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks.
	Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers
	in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation
	matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical
	and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation
	matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks,
	we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient
	in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length
	(2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network,
	whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters
	have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the
	macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical
	core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated
	power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions
	of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections
	to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal
	association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were
	topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to
	targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network,
	but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated,
	low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world
	architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity
	of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical
	for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate
	for segregated and distributed information processing.},

	of applying the same method to task-related activation datasets.
	Functional connectivity analysis is first performed in areas not
	involved with the task. Then a method is devised to remove the effects
	of activation from the data using independent component analysis
	(ICA) and functional connectivity analysis is repeated. Functional
	connectivity, which is demonstrated in the "resting brain," is not
	affected by tasks which activate unrelated brain regions. In addition,
	ICA effectively removes activation from the data and may allow us
	to study functional connectivity even in the activated regions.},

  abstract = {The ability to stop motor responses depends critically on the right
	inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and also engages a midbrain region
	consistent with the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Here we used diffusion-weighted
	imaging (DWI) tractography to show that the IFC and the STN region
	are connected via a white matter tract, which could underlie a "hyperdirect"
	pathway for basal ganglia control. Using a novel method of "triangulation"
	analysis of tractography data, we also found that both the IFC and
	the STN region are connected with the presupplementary motor area
	(preSMA). We hypothesized that the preSMA could play a conflict detection/resolution
	role within a network between the preSMA, the IFC, and the STN region.
	A second experiment tested this idea with functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) using a conditional stop-signal paradigm, enabling
	examination of behavioral and neural signatures of conflict-induced
	slowing. The preSMA, IFC, and STN region were significantly activated
	the greater the conflict-induced slowing. Activation corresponded
	strongly with spatial foci predicted by the DWI tract analysis, as
	well as with foci activated by complete response inhibition. The
	results illustrate how tractography can reveal connections that are
	verifiable with fMRI. The results also demonstrate a three-way functional-anatomical
	network in the right hemisphere that could either brake or completely
	stop responses.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) is an emerging imaging modality
	whose importance has been growing considerably. However, the processing
	of this type of data (i.e., symmetric positive-definite matrices),
	called "tensors" here, has proved difficult in recent years. Usual
	Euclidean operations on matrices suffer from many defects on tensors,
	which have led to the use of many ad hoc methods. Recently, affine-invariant
	Riemannian metrics have been proposed as a rigorous and general framework
	in which these defects are corrected. These metrics have excellent
	theoretical properties and provide powerful processing tools, but
	also lead in practice to complex and slow algorithms. To remedy this
	limitation, a new family of Riemannian metrics called Log-Euclidean
	is proposed in this article. They also have excellent theoretical
	properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler
	and faster computations. This new approach is based on a novel vector
	space structure for tensors. In this framework, Riemannian computations
	can be converted into Euclidean ones once tensors have been transformed
	into their matrix logarithms. Theoretical aspects are presented and
	the Euclidean, affine-invariant, and Log-Euclidean frameworks are
	compared experimentally. The comparison is carried out on interpolation
	and regularization tasks on synthetic and clinical 3D DTI data.},

	integration of spatiotemporal information use the same neural substrate
	or is the role of the left inferior parietal cortex restricted to
	visuomotor transformations? We use fMRI and a collision judgment
	paradigm to examine whether the left inferior parietal cortex integrates
	temporal and spatial variables in situations in which no complex
	action and no visuomotor transformation is required. We used a perceptual
	task in which healthy subjects indicated by simple button presses
	whether two moving objects (of the same or different size) would
	or would not collide with each other. This task of interest was contrasted
	with a control task that employed the same stimuli and identical
	motor responses but in which the size of the two moving objects had
	to be compared. To assess putative differential eye-movement effects
	both tasks were performed with and without central fixation. Analysis
	of the fMRI data (employing a random-effects model and SPM99) showed
	that collision judgments (relative to size judgments) provoked a
	significant increase in neural activity in the left inferior parietal
	cortex (supramarginal gyrus) only. These results show that left inferior
	parietal cortex is involved in the integration of perceptual spatiotemporal
	information and thus provide a neural correlate for the use of space-time
	plans (whose perturbation can lead to apraxia as originally hypothesized
	by Liepmann). Furthermore, the data suggest that the left supramarginal
	gyrus combines temporal and spatial variables more widely than previously
	supposed.},

  abstract = {Until the advent of MR imaging, knowledge of the structure of myelin
	and the process of myelination were of little importance to the neuroradiologist.
	Other than some mild changes in the attenuation of white matter,
	myelination resulted in no significant alterations of CT (1) or sonographic
	studies. MR studies, on the other hand, have been increasingly used
	for pediatric brain imaging. MR imaging's greater sensitivity to
	small changes in the water content of brain tissue, to changes in
	the binding of free water (revealed by magnetization transfer), and
	to the extent and anisotropy of water diffusion (revealed by diffusion
	imaging) has cast new light on this very complex and important molecule.
	Assessing myelination has become a key component of evaluating the
	child with delayed development. Moreover, better understanding of
	the nature of myelin and the effect of its different components on
	MR imaging parameters may help us to understand and diagnose inborn
	errors of metabolism better. In this review, I discuss what is known
	regarding the function and structure of CNS myelin and the effects
	of the various components of myelin on the signal imparted to the
	MR image. Summary Abnormalities of myelin can cause a wide variety
	of disorders of the nervous system. MR imaging is a powerful tool
	for the study of myelin and its disorders. However, only by understanding
	the physiologic properties and structure of myelin can we use MR
	imaging to its fullest capacity for studying patients with myelin
	disorders. In this review, I have discussed the structure of myelin
	as it relates to MR imaging of normal myelination and to neurologic
	disorders resulting from abnormalities of myelin. Thinking of myelin
	and its disorders in this manner will be critical to using MR imaging

  abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI consists of deriving and displaying
	parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e.,
	that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and
	microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and
	insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here,
	these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion
	isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel
	measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from
	the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel.
	First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts,
	[D] I and D - [D] I, respectively (where [D] = Trace(D)/3 is the
	mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor
	(dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally
	and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these
	quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion
	tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series
	of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain.
	Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes
	in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and
	organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications
	include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and

	success in tracing pathways into gray matter. Here we identified
	specific connections between human thalamus and cortex using a novel
	probabilistic tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data.
	Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity
	patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond
	to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections
	that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported
	for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals.
	Our results provide the first quantitative demonstration of reliable
	inference of anatomical connectivity between human gray matter structures
	using diffusion data and the first connectivity-based segmentation
	of gray matter.},

	This change may help counteract age-related neurocognitive decline

	fiber tracking based on diffusion-weighted imaging provides information
	about anatomical connectivity between brain structures, and functional

	We found that, during a feedback-guided reversal learning task, the
	strength of estimated white matter tracts from the amygdala to the

	both how subjects adapted their behavior following positive and negative
	feedback, and the functional connectivity (estimated from functional

	we identified a dissociation between an amygdala-hippocampus circuit
	that predicted response switching, and an amygdala-orbitofrontal
	cortex circuit that predicted learning following rule reversals.
	These findings provide novel insights into how the anatomy and functioning

	modality to study properties of white matter and the geometry of

	a new framework for quantitative tract-oriented DTI analysis that

	nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. A new measure of tensor anisotropy,
	called geodesic anisotropy (GA) is applied and compared with FA.
	As a result, tracts of interest are represented by the geometry of
	the medial spine attributed with tensor statistics (average and variance)
	calculated within cross-sections. Feasibility of our approach is
	demonstrated on various fiber tracts of a single data set. A validation

	strength. However, functional connectivity is also observed between
	regions where there is little or no structural connectivity, which
	most likely indicates functional correlations mediated by indirect
	structural connections (i.e. via a third region). As the methodologies

	improve and their complementary strengths are applied in parallel,

	this deterioration is assumed to be at least partly a consequence
	of myelin degeneration. The present study investigated specific predictions
	of the myelodegeneration hypothesis using diffusion tensor tractography.
	This technique has several advantages over other methods of assessing
	white matter architecture, including the possibility of isolating
	individual white matter tracts and measuring effects along the whole
	extent of each tract. The study yielded three main findings. First,
	age-related white matter deficits increased gradually from posterior
	to anterior segments within specific fiber tracts traversing frontal
	and parietal, but not temporal cortex. This pattern inverts the sequence
	of myelination during childhood and early development observed in
	previous studies and lends support to a "last-in-first-out" theory
	of the white matter health across the lifespan. Second, both the
	effects of aging on white matter and their impact on cognitive performance
	were stronger for radial diffusivity (RD) than for axial diffusivity
	(AD). Given that RD has previously been shown to be more sensitive
	to myelin integrity than AD, this second finding is also consistent
	with the myelodegeneration hypothesis. Finally, the effects of aging
	on select white matter tracts were associated with age difference
	in specific cognitive functions. Specifically, FA in anterior tracts
	was shown to be primarily associated with executive tasks and FA
	in posterior tracts mainly associated with visual memory tasks. Furthermore,
	these correlations were mirrored in RD, but not AD, suggesting that
	RD is more sensitive to age-related changes in cognition. Taken together,
	the results help to clarify how age-related white matter decline
	impairs cognitive performance.},

	natural and artificial language processing. Twelve young, right-handed

	from its right-hemispheric homologue. Variability in performance
	based on superficial familiarity did not show this association. Moreover,
	when Broca's area was used as a seed mask for probabilistic tractography,
	we found that mean FA values within the generated tracts was higher
	in subjects with better grammar learning. Our findings provide the
	first evidence that integrity of white matter fibre tracts arising

  abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear principal component analysis (PCA)
	that identifies underlying sources causing the expression of spatial
	modes or patterns of activity in neuroimaging time-series. The critical
	aspect of this technique is that, in relation to conventional PCA,
	the sources can interact to produce (second-order) spatial modes
	that represent the modulation of one (first-order) spatial mode by
	another. This nonlinear PCA uses a simple neural network architecture
	that embodies a specific form for the nonlinear mixing of sources
	that cause observed data. This form is motivated by a second-order
	approximation to any general nonlinear mixing and emphasizes interactions
	among pairs of sources. By introducing these nonlinearities principal
	components obtain with a unique rotation and scaling that does not
	depend on the biologically implausible constraints adopted by conventional
	PCA. The technique is illustrated by application to functional (positron
	emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging) imaging
	data where the ensuing first- and second-order modes can be interpreted
	in terms of distributed brain systems. The interactions among sources
	render the expression of any one mode context-sensitive, where that
	context is established by the expression of other modes. The examples
	considered include interactions between cognitive states and time
	(i.e. adaptation or plasticity in PET data) and among functionally
	specialized brain systems (using a fMRI study of colour and motion

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The early postnatal period is perhaps the
	most dynamic phase of white matter development. We hypothesized that
	the early postnatal development of the corpus callosum and corticospinal
	tracts could be studied in unsedated healthy neonates by using novel
	approaches to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative tractography.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isotropic 2 x 2 x 2 mm(3) DTI and structural
	images were acquired from 47 healthy neonates. DTI and structural
	images were coregistered and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity
	(MD), and normalized T1-weighted (T1W) and T2-weighted (T2W) signal
	intensities were determined in central midline and peripheral cortical
	regions of the white matter tracts of the genu and splenium of the
	corpus callosum and the central midbrain and peripheral cortical
	regions of the corticospinal tracts by using quantitative tractography.
	RESULTS: We observed that central regions exhibited lower MD, higher
	FA values, higher T1W intensity, and lower T2W intensity than peripheral
	cortical regions. As expected, MD decreased, FA increased, and T2W
	signal intensity decreased with increasing age in the genu and corticospinal
	tract, whereas there was no significant change in T1W signal intensity.
	The central midline region of the splenium fiber tract has a unique
	pattern, with no change in MD, FA, or T2W signal intensity with age,
	suggesting different growth trajectory compared with the other tracts.
	FA seems to be more dependent on tract organization, whereas MD seems
	to be more sensitive to myelination. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach
	may detect small regional differences and age-related changes in
	the corpus callosum and corticospinal white matter tracts in unsedated
	healthy neonates and may be used for future studies of pediatric
	brain disorders that affect developing white matter.},

	tensor images. Unbiased diffeomorphic atlas building is used to compute
	a normalized coordinate system for populations of diffusion images.
	The diffeomorphic transformations between each subject and the atlas

	Diffusion properties, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and tensor
	norm, along fiber tracts are modeled as multivariate functions of
	arc length. Hypothesis testing is performed non-parametrically using
	permutation testing based on the Hotelling T(2) statistic. The linear
	discriminant embedded in the T(2) metric provides an intuitive, localized
	interpretation of detected differences. The proposed methodology
	was tested on two clinical studies of neurodevelopment. In a study
	of 1 and 2 year old subjects, a significant increase in FA and a
	correlated decrease in Frobenius norm was found in several tracts.
	Significant differences in neonates were found in the splenium tract

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of major depression
	have revealed resting-state abnormalities in the prefrontal and cingulate
	cortices. Recently, fMRI has been adapted to examine connectivity
	within a specific resting-state neural network--the default-mode
	network--that includes medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices.
	The goal of this study was to examine resting-state, default-mode
	network functional connectivity in subjects with major depression
	and in healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects with major
	depression and 20 healthy controls underwent 5-min fMRI scans while
	resting quietly. Independent component analysis was used to isolate
	the default-mode network in each subject. Group maps of the default-mode
	network were compared. A within-group analysis was performed in the
	depressed group to explore effects of depression refractoriness on
	functional connectivity. RESULTS: Resting-state subgenual cingulate
	and thalamic functional connectivity with the default-mode network
	were significantly greater in the depressed subjects. Within the
	depressed group, the length of the current depressive episode correlated
	positively with functional connectivity in the subgenual cingulate.
	CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore default-mode functional
	connectivity in major depression. The findings provide cross-modality
	confirmation of PET studies demonstrating increased thalamic and
	subgenual cingulate activity in major depression. Further, the within-subject
	connectivity analysis employed here brings these previously isolated
	regions of hypermetabolism into the context of a disordered neural
	network. The correlation between refractoriness and subgenual cingulate
	functional connectivity within the network suggests that a quantitative,
	resting-state fMRI measure could be used to guide therapy in individual
	subjects.},

	the major recent methodological developments and their exceptional

	computational models of complex networks such as graph theory. RECENT
	FINDINGS: Imaging structural and functional brain connectivity has
	revealed the complex brain organization into large-scale networks.
	Such an organization not only permits the complex information segregation
	and integration during high cognitive processes but also determines
	the clinical consequences of alterations encountered in development,
	ageing, or neurological diseases. Recently, it has also been demonstrated
	that human brain networks shared topological properties with the
	so-called 'small-world' mathematical model, allowing a maximal efficiency
	with a minimal energy and wiring cost. SUMMARY: Separately, magnetic
	resonance tractography and functional MRI connectivity have both
	brought new insights into brain organization and the impact of injuries.
	The small-world topology of structural and functional human brain
	networks offers a common framework to merge structural and functional
	imaging as well as dynamical data from electrophysiology that might
	allow a comprehensive definition of the brain organization and plasticity.},

	Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these

	connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network
	that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque
	neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify
	functional networks, we find structure-function relations at multiple
	temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows
	of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying
	structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional
	networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant
	fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence
	of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows.
	The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time
	as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings
	between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the
	existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked
	by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying
	structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds)
	we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and
	find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes,
	contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer
	entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent
	correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

  abstract = {To understand the effects of a cortical lesion it is necessary to
	consider not only the loss of local neural function, but also the
	lesion-induced changes in the larger network of endogenous oscillatory
	interactions in the brain. To investigate how network embedding influences
	a region's functional role, and the consequences of its being damaged,
	we implement two models of oscillatory cortical interactions, both
	of which inherit their coupling architecture from the available anatomical
	connection data for macaque cerebral cortex. In the first model,
	node dynamics are governed by Kuramoto phase oscillator equations,
	and we investigate the sequence in which areas entrain one another
	in the transition to global synchrony. In the second model, node
	dynamics are governed by a more realistic neural mass model, and
	we assess long-run inter-regional interactions using a measure of
	directed information flow. Highly connected parietal and frontal
	areas are found to synchronize most rapidly, more so than equally
	highly connected visual and somatosensory areas, and this difference
	can be explained in terms of the network's clustered architecture.
	For both models, lesion effects extend beyond the immediate neighbors
	of the lesioned site, and the amplitude and dispersal of nonlocal
	effects are again influenced by cluster patterns in the network.
	Although the consequences of in vivo lesions will always depend on
	circuitry local to the damaged site, we conclude that lesions of
	parietal regions (especially areas 5 and 7a) and frontal regions
	(especially areas 46 and FEF) have the greatest potential to disrupt
	the integrative aspects of neocortical function.},

	connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural

	whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including

	We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and
	structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography)
	in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity
	then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics.
	In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections
	commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection,
	rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional
	connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional
	distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity
	that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii)
	that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within
	and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical
	and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional
	connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions
	without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and

	voxels are modeled as nodes of a non-directed graph in which the

	is estimated by means of probabilistic tissue segmentation and intravoxel
	white matter orientational distribution function, obtained from anatomical

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Recovery mechanisms supporting upper extremity motor recovery
	following stroke are well established, but cortical mechanism associated
	with lower extremity motor recovery is unknown. The aim of this study
	was to assess cortical reorganization associated with lower extremity
	motor recovery in a hemiparetic patient. METHODS: Six control subjects
	and a 17 year-old woman with left intracerebral hemorrhage due to
	an arterio-venous malformation rupture were evaluated. The motor
	function of the paretic (left) hip and knee had recovered slowly
	to the extent of her being able to overcome gravity for 10 months
	after the onset of stroke. However, her paretic upper extremity showed
	no significant motor recovery. Blood oxygenation level dependent
	(BOLD) functional MRI at 1.5 Tesla was used to determine the acutual
	location of cortical activation in the predefined regions of interest.
	Concurrently, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in combination with
	a novel 3D-fiber reconstruction algorithm was utilized to investigate
	the pattern of the corticospinal pathway connectivity between the
	areas of the motor stream. All subjects' body parts were secured
	in the scanner and performed a sequential knee flexion-extension
	with a predetermined angle of 0-60 degrees at 0.5 Hz. RESULTS: Controls
	showed anticipated activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex
	(SM1) and the descending corticospinal fibers stemming from motor
	cortex. In contrast to control normal subjects, the stroke patient
	showed fMRI activation only in the unaffected (right) primary SM1
	during either paretic or nonparetic knee movements. DTT fiber tracing
	data showed that the corticospinal tract fibers were found only in
	the unaffected hemisphere but not in the affected hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results indicate that an ipsilateral motor pathway from the unaffected
	(right) motor cortex to the paretic (right) leg was present in this
	patient. This study raises the potential that the contralesional
	(ipsilateral) SM1 is involved in cortical reorganization associated
	lower extremity motor recovery in stroke. This study is the first
	neuroimaging evidence that the combined fMRI and DTI fiber tracing
	can significantly expand the explanatory power of probing cortical
	reorganization underlying motor recovery mechanism in stroke.},

  abstract = {Consciousness combines information about attributes of the present
	multimodal sensory environment with relevant elements of the past.
	Information from each modality is continuously fractionated into
	distinct features, processed locally by different brain regions relatively
	specialized for extracting these disparate components and globally
	by interactions among these regions. Information is represented by
	levels of synchronization within neuronal populations and of coherence
	among multiple brain regions that deviate from random fluctuations.
	Significant deviations constitute local and global negative entropy,
	or information. Local field potentials reflect the degree of synchronization
	among the neurons of the local ensembles. Large-scale integration,
	or 'binding', is proposed to involve oscillations of local field
	potentials that play an important role in facilitating synchronization
	and coherence, assessed by neuronal coincidence detectors, and parsed
	into perceptual frames by cortico-thalamo-cortical loops. The most
	probable baseline levels of local synchrony, coherent interactions
	among brain regions, and frame durations have been quantitatively
	described in large studies of their age-appropriate normative distributions
	and are considered as an approximation to a conscious 'ground state'.
	The level of consciousness during anesthesia can be accurately predicted
	by the magnitude and direction of reversible multivariate deviations
	from this ground state. An invariant set of changes takes place during
	anesthesia, independent of the particular anesthetic agent. Evidence
	from a variety of neuroscience areas supporting these propositions,
	together with the invariant reversible electrophysiological changes
	observed with loss and return of consciousness, are used to provide
	a foundation for this theory of consciousness. This paper illustrates
	the increasingly recognized need to consider global as well as local
	processes in the search for better explanations of how the brain
	accomplishes the transformation from synchronous and distributed
	neuronal discharges to seamless global subjective awareness.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) has previously
	been used to investigate white matter tracts in schizophrenia, with
	inconsistent results. The aim of the study was to use a novel method
	for tract-specific measurements of fronto-temporal fasciculi in early-onset
	schizophrenia. We hypothesized that by making tract-specific measurements,
	clear diffusion abnormalities would be revealed in specific fasciculi
	in schizophrenia. Measurements of diffusion anisotropy and mean diffusivity
	were localized within fronto-temporal fasciculi by forming 3-D reconstructions
	of the cingulum, uncinate, superior longitudinal, and inferior fronto-occipital
	fasciculi using diffusion tensor tractography. We were limited in
	our ability to test our hypothesis by the important and surprising
	finding that age affected DT-MRI-based measures in schizophrenia
	patients in a different way from comparison subjects, most notably
	in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus. The youngest schizophrenia
	patients that we studied had lower diffusion anisotropy than age-matched
	comparison subjects, but this difference diminished with increasing
	age. The main conclusion of this study was that direct comparisons
	of absolute DT-MRI-based measures between individuals with schizophrenia
	and comparison subjects may be problematic and misleading because
	of underlying age-related differences in brain maturation between
	groups.},

	providing information about both the structural integrity and the
	orientation of white matter fibers in vivo and, through "tractography",
	revealing the trajectories of white matter tracts. DT-MRI is therefore
	a promising technique for detecting differences in white matter architecture
	between different subject populations. However, while studies involving
	analyses of group averages of scalar quantities derived from DT-MRI
	data have been performed, as yet there have been no similar studies
	involving the whole tensor. Here we present the first step towards
	realizing such a study, i.e., the spatial normalization of whole
	tensor data sets. The approach is illustrated by spatial normalization
	of 10 DT-MRI data sets to a standard anatomical template. Both qualitative
	and quantitative approaches are described for assessing the results
	of spatial normalization. Techniques are then described for combining
	the spatially normalized data sets according to three definitions
	of average, i.e., the mean, median, and mode of a distribution of
	tensors. The current absence of, and hence need for, appropriate
	statistical tests for comparison of results derived from group-averaged
	DT-MRI data sets is then discussed. Finally, the feasibility of performing
	tractography on the group-averaged DT-MRI data set is investigated
	and the possibility and implications of generating a generic map
	of brain connectivity from a group of subjects is considered.},

	MRI (DT-MRI) data in a number of studies. In VBM, following spatial
	normalization, data are smoothed to improve the validity of statistical
	inferences and to reduce inter-individual variation. However, the
	size of the smoothing filter used for VBM of DT-MRI data is highly
	variable across studies. For example, a literature review revealed
	that Gaussian smoothing kernels ranging in size (full width at half
	maximum) from zero to 16 mm have been used in DT-MRI VBM type studies.
	To investigate the effect of varying filter size in such analyses,
	whole brain DT-MRI data from 14 schizophrenic patients were compared
	with those of 14 matched control subjects using VBM, when the filter
	size was varied from zero to 16 mm. Within this range of smoothing,
	four different conclusions regarding apparent patient control differences
	could be made: (i) no significant patient-control differences; (ii)
	reduced FA in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in patients; (iii)
	reduced FA in both right STG and left cerebellum in patients; and
	(iv) reduced FA only in left cerebellum in patients. These findings
	stress the importance of recognizing the effect of the matched filter
	theorem on VBM analyses of DT-MRI data. Finally, we investigated
	whether one of the underlying assumptions of parametric VBM, i.e.,
	the normality of the residuals, is met. Our results suggest that,
	even with moderate smoothing, a large number of voxels within central
	white matter regions may have non-normally distributed residuals
	thus making valid statistical inferences with a parametric approach
	problematic in these areas.},

	has drawn increasing attention of neuroscientists and computer scientists,
	since it opens a new window to explore functional network of human
	brain with relatively high resolution. A variety of methods for fcMRI
	study have been proposed. This paper intends to provide a technical
	review on computational methodologies developed for fcMRI analysis.
	From our perspective, these computational methods are classified
	into two general categories: model-driven methods and data-driven
	methods. Data-driven methods are a large family, and thus are further
	sub-classified into decomposition-based methods and clustering analysis
	methods. For each type of methods, principles, main contributors,
	and their advantages and drawbacks are discussed. Finally, potential
	applications of fcMRI are overviewed.},

  abstract = {In this study, we introduced a length-normalized parameterization
	method to establish anatomical correspondence of white matter fiber
	tracts across subjects and applied this method to investigate the
	presence of abnormal diffusion along the pyramidal tract (PYT) of
	relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) patients without visible brain
	lesions. In this approach, the part of the PYT between the lowest
	slice of the cerebral peduncle and the uppermost slice of the lateral
	ventricle was reconstructed to establish the anatomical correspondence
	across subjects using diffusion tensor tractography. Then it was
	parameterized by normalizing its length and dividing equally the
	normalized length into a certain number of segments, so that the
	comparability of each segment across subjects along the PYT was established.
	Tract-specific diffusion indices, including directionally averaged
	diffusivity (D(av)), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary diffusivity
	(lambda(1)) and transverse diffusivity (lambda(23)), were obtained
	from each segment. Thus, the distribution maps of these indices along
	the PYT were obtained. The distribution maps of D(av), FA, and lambda(23)
	of RNMO patients were significantly different from those of healthy
	controls, especially in the lower part of the PYT. The differences
	may be caused by secondary degeneration to lesions in the spinal
	cord. In conclusion, a length-normalized parameterization method
	is proposed to establish anatomical correspondence for the PYT. Compared
	with existed methods, a major merit of our method is to provide comparability
	across subjects along the PYT on the basis of diffusion tensor tractography
	and to make it possible for the quantitative analysis along the fiber
	tract. This method can also be used to quantitatively analyze other
	white matter fiber tracts between two definite anatomic landmarks
	in many neurological or psychiatric diseases.},

	along the fiber pathways is not only necessary for accurate clustering
	of the trajectories into fiber bundles, but also crucial for any
	tract-oriented quantitative analysis. We employ an expectation-maximization
	(EM) algorithm to cluster the trajectories in a gamma mixture model
	context. The result of clustering is the probabilistic assignment
	of the fiber trajectories to each cluster, an estimate of the cluster
	parameters, i.e. spatial mean and variance, and point correspondences.
	The fiber bundles are modeled by the mean trajectory and its spatial
	variation. Point-by-point correspondence of the trajectories within
	a bundle is obtained by constructing a distance map and a label map
	from each cluster center at every iteration of the EM algorithm.
	This offers a time-efficient alternative to pairwise curve matching
	of all trajectories with respect to each cluster center. The proposed
	method has the potential to benefit from an anatomical atlas of fiber
	tracts by incorporating it as prior information in the EM algorithm.
	The algorithm is also capable of handling outliers in a principled

	(PET), can provide information about the functional interactions
	within entire neural systems. With the large quantity of data that
	can accumulate from a mapping study, a network analysis, which makes
	sense of the complex interactions among neural elements, is necessary.
	A network analysis was performed on data obtained from a PET study
	that examined both the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
	and interregional correlations among human cortical areas during
	performance of an object vision (face matching) and spatial vision
	(dot-location matching) task. Brain areas for the network were selected
	based on regions showing significant rCBF or interregional correlations
	between tasks. Anterior temporal and frontal lobe regions were added
	to the network using a principal components analysis. Interactions
	among selected regions were quantified with structural equation modeling.
	In the structural equation models, connections between brain areas
	were based on known neuroanatomy and the interregional correlations
	were used to calculate path coefficients representing the magnitude
	of the influence of each directional path. The combination of the
	anatomical network and interregional correlations created a functional
	network for each task. The functional network for the right hemisphere
	showed that in the object vision task, dominant path influences were
	among occipitotemporal areas, while in the spatial vision task, occipitoparietal
	interactions were stronger. The network for the spatial vision task
	also had a strong feedback path from area 46 to occipital cortex,
	an effect that was absent in the object vision task. There were strong
	interactions between dorsal and ventral pathways in both networks.
	Functional networks for the left hemisphere did not differ between
	tasks. Networks for the interhemispheric interactions showed that
	the dominant pathway in the right hemisphere also had stronger effects
	on homologous left hemisphere areas and are consistent with a hypothesis

  abstract = {Sensory information undergoes extensive associative elaboration and
	attentional modulation as it becomes incorporated into the texture
	of cognition. This process occurs along a core synaptic hierarchy
	which includes the primary sensory, upstream unimodal, downstream
	unimodal, heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic zones of the cerebral
	cortex. Connections from one zone to another are reciprocal and allow
	higher synaptic levels to exert a feedback (top-down) influence upon
	earlier levels of processing. Each cortical area provides a nexus
	for the convergence of afferents and divergence of efferents. The
	resultant synaptic organization supports parallel as well as serial
	processing, and allows each sensory event to initiate multiple cognitive
	and behavioural outcomes. Upstream sectors of unimodal association
	areas encode basic features of sensation such as colour, motion,
	form and pitch. More complex contents of sensory experience such
	as objects, faces, word-forms, spatial locations and sound sequences
	become encoded within downstream sectors of unimodal areas by groups
	of coarsely tuned neurons. The highest synaptic levels of sensory-fugal
	processing are occupied by heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic cortices,
	collectively known as transmodal areas. The unique role of these
	areas is to bind multiple unimodal and other transmodal areas into
	distributed but integrated multimodal representations. Transmodal
	areas in the midtemporal cortex, Wernicke's area, the hippocampal-entorhinal
	complex and the posterior parietal cortex provide critical gateways
	for transforming perception into recognition, word-forms into meaning,
	scenes and events into experiences, and spatial locations into targets
	for exploration. All cognitive processes arise from analogous associative
	transformations of similar sets of sensory inputs. The differences
	in the resultant cognitive operation are determined by the anatomical
	and physiological properties of the transmodal node that acts as
	the critical gateway for the dominant transformation. Interconnected
	sets of transmodal nodes provide anatomical and computational epicentres
	for large-scale neurocognitive networks. In keeping with the principles
	of selectively distributed processing, each epicentre of a large-scale
	network displays a relative specialization for a specific behavioural
	component of its principal neurospychological domain. The destruction
	of transmodal epicentres causes global impairments such as multimodal
	anomia, neglect and amnesia, whereas their selective disconnection
	from relevant unimodal areas elicits modality-specific impairments
	such as prosopagnosia, pure word blindness and category-specific
	anomias. The human brain contains at least five anatomically distinct
	networks. The network for spatial awareness is based on transmodal
	epicentres in the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal eye fields;
	the language network on epicentres in Wernicke's and Broca's areas;
	the explicit memory/emotion network on epicentres in the hippocampal-entorhinal
	complex and the amygdala; the face-object recognition network on
	epicentres in the midtemporal and temporopolar cortices; and the
	working memory-executive function network on epicentres in the lateral
	prefrontal cortex and perhaps the posterior parietal cortex. Individual
	sensory modalities give rise to streams of processing directed to
	transmodal nodes belonging to each of these networks. The fidelity
	of sensory channels is actively protected through approximately four
	synaptic levels of sensory-fugal processing. The modality-specific
	cortices at these four synaptic levels encode the most veridical
	representations of experience. Attentional, motivational and emotional
	modulations, including those related to working memory, novelty-seeking
	and mental imagery, become increasingly more pronounced within downstream
	components of unimodal areas, where they help to create a highly
	edited subjective version of the world. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

	sequential and hierarchical progression toward predetermined goals
	but instead by a simultaneous and interactive consideration of multiple

	The resultant texture of mental activity is characterized by almost
	infinite richness and flexibility. According to this model, complex
	behavior is mapped at the level of multifocal neural systems rather
	than specific anatomical sites, giving rise to brain-behavior relationships
	that are both localized and distributed. Each network contains anatomically
	addressed channels for transferring information content and chemically
	addressed pathways for modulating behavioral tone. This approach
	provides a blueprint for reexploring the neurological foundations
	of attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function.},

	white matter fiber tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle
	segmentations, we generate an arc length parameterization of the
	bundle with point correspondences across all fibers and all subjects,
	allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this paper we present
	a quantitative comparison of fiber coordinate systems from the literature
	and we introduce an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial
	distortion and improves intra- and inter-subject variability of FA
	measurements. We propose a method for generating arc length correspondences
	across hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric diffusion
	asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and cingulum bundle (CB).
	The results of this study demonstrate that TBM can detect differences
	that may not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in
	entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD) differences found
	in AF. We report TBM results of higher fractional anisotropy (FA)
	in the left hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3),
	the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left AF),
	and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to higher lambda(1),
	the largest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left CB).
	By mapping the significance levels onto the tractography trajectories
	for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical locations of the
	interhemispheric differences. The TBM approach brings analysis of
	DTI data into the clinically and neuroanatomically relevant framework
	of the tract anatomy.},

	aged 8-18 years were investigated. Brain activity was measured using
	the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast with functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a working
	memory (WM) task. White matter microstructure was investigated using
	diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Based on the DTI data, we calculated
	fractional anisotropy (FA), an indicator of myelination and axon
	thickness. Prior to scanning, WM score was evaluated. WM score correlated
	independently with FA values and BOLD response in several regions.
	FA values and BOLD response were extracted for each subject from
	the peak voxels of these regions. The FA values were used as covariates
	in an additional BOLD analysis to find brain regions where FA values
	and BOLD response correlated. Conversely, the BOLD response values
	were used as covariates in an additional FA analysis. In several
	cortical and sub-cortical regions, there were positive correlations
	between maturation of white matter and increased brain activity.
	Specifically, and consistent with our hypothesis, we found that FA
	values in fronto-parietal white matter correlated with BOLD response
	in closely located grey matter in the superior frontal sulcus and

  abstract = {The inherently multivariate nature of functional brain imaging data
	affords the unique opportunity to explore how anatomically disparate
	brain areas interact during cognitive tasks. We introduce a new method
	for characterizing inter-regional interactions using event-related
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This method's
	principle advantage over existing analytical techniques is its ability
	to model the functional connectivity between brain regions during
	distinct stages of a cognitive task. The method is implemented by
	using separate covariates to model the activity evoked during each
	stage of each individual trial in the context of the general linear
	model (GLM). The resulting parameter estimates (beta values) are
	sorted according to the stage from which they were derived to form
	a set of stage-specific beta series. Regions whose beta series are
	correlated during a given stage are inferred to be functionally interacting
	during that stage. To validate the assumption that correlated fluctuations
	in trial-to-trial beta values imply functional connectivity, we applied
	the method to an event-related fMRI data set in which subjects performed
	two sequence-tapping tasks. In concordance with previous electrophysiological
	and fMRI coherence studies, we found that the task requiring greater
	bimanual coordination induced stronger correlations between motor
	regions of the two hemispheres. The method was then applied to an
	event-related fMRI data set in which subjects performed a delayed
	recognition task. Distinct functional connectivity maps were generated
	during the component stages of this task, illustrating how important
	and novel observations of neural networks within the isolated stages
	of a cognitive task can be obtained.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To obtain normative human cerebral data and evaluate the
	anatomic information in quantitative diffusion anisotropy magnetic
	resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative diffusion
	anisotropy MR images were obtained in 13 healthy adults by using
	single-shot echo-planar MR imaging and a combination of tetrahedral
	and orthogonal gradient encoding (whole-brain coverage in about 1
	minute). White matter (WM) anatomy was assessed at visual inspection,
	and values were measured in various brain regions. Different anisotropy
	measures, including total anisotropy (A sigma), were compared on
	the basis of information content, rotational invariance, and susceptibility
	to noise. Partial volume and noise effects were simulated. RESULTS:
	Anisotropy MR images depicted WM features not typically seen on conventional
	MR images (e.g., external capsule, thalamic substructures, basal
	ganglia, occipital WM, thickness of the internal capsule). Statistically
	significant anisotropy differences occurred across brain regions,
	which were reproducible within and across subjects. A sigma was highest
	in commissural WM and progressively lower in projection and association
	WM. This order paralleled that of known resistance to spread of vasogenic
	edema, which suggested that anisotropy may be sensitive to WM histologic
	structure. Gray matter (GM) A sigma data were consistent with zero
	anisotropy, and partial volume WM-GM effects were approximately linear.
	A sigma image quality could be effectively improved by means of averaging.
	CONCLUSION: Quantitative diffusion anisotropy images can be obtained
	rapidly and demonstrate subtle WM anatomy. Different histologic types
	of WM have significant and reproducible anisotropy differences.},

	in preservation of motor function in patients with brain tumors.
	The goal of the present study was to investigate whether function
	of the primary motor area (M1) was restored and whether motor function
	improved after brain tumor resection. METHODS: Five patients with
	metastatic brain tumors located within or near M1 underwent awake
	surgery with intraoperative cortical mapping and continuous task
	monitoring. Preoperative and postoperative functional MR imaging
	(fMRI) was performed during hand clenching, and diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) was performed in 1 case to further characterize the
	area activated in fMRI. RESULTS: Preoperative fMRI performed during
	hand clenching demonstrated reorganization of motor function. In
	patients with severe paresis (cases 3, 4, and 5), clenching of the
	affected hand induced a large blood oxygen level-dependent response
	in the right hemisphere, mainly in the anterior temporal lobe, despite
	the location site of the tumor. Postoperative fMRI during hand clenching
	demonstrated activation of the contralateral M1. Furthermore, in
	case 5, DTI detected tracts, possibly the inferior longitudinal fasciculus,
	arising from anterior temporal activated area as well as tracts connecting
	the premotor and M1 activated area. This patient demonstrated mirror
	movement of the hand during the course of motor function recovery.
	CONCLUSIONS: Tumor resection resulted in restoration of M1 function
	and improved motor function in patients with preoperative reorganization
	of M1 function. Furthermore, the preoperative reorganization of motor
	function in cases with severe paresis may be related to changes in
	the right hemisphere, including the temporal lobe.},

	tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion
	data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly
	directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are
	starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order
	to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and

	subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from
	the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness
	of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved.
	In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues
	via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b)
	projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the

	We examine these connection patterns by calculating a broad range
	of structural measures, including small-world attributes and motif
	composition, as well as some global measures of functional connectivity,
	including complexity. As we vary fractal patterns by changing a critical
	control parameter, we find strongly correlated changes in several
	structural and functional measures, suggesting that they emerge together
	and are mutually linked. Measures obtained from some modeled fractal
	patterns closely resemble those of real neuroanatomical data sets,
	supporting the original hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Brain regions in the mammalian cerebral cortex are linked by a complex

	length and clustering coefficient distributions. In this paper we
	focus on the identification and classification of hub regions, which
	are thought to play pivotal roles in the coordination of information
	flow. We identify hubs and characterize their network contributions
	by examining motif fingerprints and centrality indices for all regions
	within the cerebral cortices of both the cat and the macaque. Motif
	fingerprints capture the statistics of local connection patterns,
	while measures of centrality identify regions that lie on many of
	the shortest paths between parts of the network. Within both cat
	and macaque networks, we find that a combination of degree, motif
	participation, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality allows
	for reliable identification of hub regions, many of which have previously
	been functionally classified as polysensory or multimodal. We then
	classify hubs as either provincial (intra-cluster) hubs or connector
	(inter-cluster) hubs, and proceed to show that lesioning hubs of
	each type from the network produces opposite effects on the small-world
	index. Our study presents an approach to the identification and classification
	of putative hub regions in brain networks on the basis of multiple

	reaction time (RT) performance yet the underlying neural mechanisms

	that interindividual variability in RT performance may be due to
	differences in white matter (WM) physiological properties, although
	such a relationship has never been demonstrated in cortical projection
	or association pathways in healthy young adults. Using diffusion
	tensor MRI (DTI), we sought to test whether diffusion tensor fractional
	anisotropy (FA), a measure of the orientational coherence of water
	self-diffusion, is regionally correlated with RT on a visual self-paced
	choice RT (CRT) task. CRT was found to be significantly correlated
	with FA in projection and association pathways supporting visuospatial
	attention including the right optic radiation, right posterior thalamus,
	and right medial precuneus WM. Significant correlations were also
	observed in left superior temporal sulcus WM and the left parietal
	operculum. The lateralization of the CRT-FA correlation to right
	visual and parietal WM pathways is consistent with the specialization
	of right visual and parietal cortices for visuospatial attention.
	The localization of the CRT-FA correlations to predominantly visual
	and parietal WM pathways, but not to motor pathways or the corpus

	tonotopic organization in PAC and found similar organization as that
	described in mammals. In contrast to what is known about PAC in primates
	and nonprimates, in humans, the structural connectivity within PAC
	has not been defined. In this study, stroboscopic event-related functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to reveal mirror symmetric
	tonotopic organization consisting of a high-low-high frequency gradient
	in PAC. Furthermore, diffusion tensor tractography and probabilistic
	mapping was used to study projection patterns within tonotopic areas.
	Based on earlier physiological and histological work in nonhuman
	PAC, we hypothesized the existence of cross-field isofrequency (homotopic)
	and within-field non-isofrequency (heterotopic)-specific axonal projections
	in human PAC. The presence of both projections types was found in
	all subjects. Specifically, the number of diffusion tensor imaging
	(DTI) reconstructed fibers projecting between high- and low-frequency
	regions was greater than those fibers projecting between 2 high-frequency
	areas, the latter of which are located in distinct auditory fields.
	The fMRI and DTI results indicate that functional and structural

	the cerebral peduncle, lowest in the caudal pons, and intermediate
	in the medulla. In the pons and medulla the regional variability
	was high, with significant differences in anisotropy even between
	contiguous slices. Multifactorial ANOVA (performed using the average
	value of anisotropy within each region of interest) revealed that
	elderly subjects had significantly lower values than young subjects
	in the cerebral peduncle, with no differences in the pons and medulla.
	No significant differences in anisotropy due to gender and side were
	found. The differences in anisotropy at different levels of the brainstem
	reflect differences in the local architecture of white matter fibers.
	Anisotropy is high in the cerebral peduncle because fibers have a
	highly ordered arrangement, while in the pons and medulla, anisotropy
	is lower because the local fiber architecture is less coherent due
	to the presence of other fibers and nuclei. The biologic meaning
	of the intergroup differences in anisotropy is discussed in light
	of the structure and architecture of the tissue under investigation.
	We also consider potential sources of artifacts, such as noise and
	motion, partial volume contamination, anatomic mismatching, and the
	use of inappropriate statistical tests. We conclude that the age-related
	decrease in anisotropy in the cerebral peduncle is not artifactual
	but rather reflects subtle structural changes of the aging white

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recovery from focal motor pathway lesions may be associated
	with a functional reorganisation of cortical motor areas. Previous
	studies of the relation between structural brain damage and the functional
	consequences have employed MRI and CT, which provide limited structural
	information. The recent development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	now provides quantitative measures of fibre tract integrity and orientation.
	The objective was to use DTI and functional MRI (fMRI) to determine
	the mechanisms underlying the excellent recovery found after a penetrating
	injury to the right capsular region. METHODS: DTI and fMRI were performed
	on the patient described; DTI was performed on five normal controls.
	RESULTS: The injury resulted in a left hemiplegia which resolved
	fully over several weeks. When studied 18 months later there was
	no pyramidal weakness, a mild hemidystonia, and sensory disturbance.
	fMRI activation maps showed contralateral primary and supplementary
	motor cortex activation during tapping of each hand; smaller ipsilateral
	primary motor areas were activated by the recovered hand only. DTI
	disclosed preserved structural integrity and orientation in the posterior
	capsular limb by contrast with the disrupted structure in the anterior
	limb on the injured side. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that
	the main recovery mechanism was a preservation of the integrity and
	orientation of pyramidal tract fibres. The fMRI studies do not suggest
	substantial reorganisation of the motor cortex, although ipsilateral
	pathways may have contributed to the recovery. The initial deficit
	was probably due to reversible local factors including oedema and
	mass effect; permanent damage to fibre tracts in the anterior capsular
	limb may account for the persistent sensory deficit. This study shows
	for the first time the potential value of combining fMRI and DTI
	together to investigate mechanisms of recovery and persistent deficit
	in an individual patient.},

	It has been shown that DTI acquisitions with a modest to large number

	the multiple averages approach. These acquisitions resist the traditional
	(regular) bootstrap analysis though. In contrast to the regular bootstrap,
	the wild bootstrap method can be applied to such protocols in which
	there is only one observation per direction. Here, we compare and
	contrast the wild bootstrap with the regular bootstrap using Monte
	Carlo numerical simulations for a number of diffusion scenarios.
	The regular and wild bootstrap methods are applied to human DTI data
	and empirical distributions are obtained for fractional anisotropy
	and the diffusion tensor eigensystem. Spatial maps of the estimated

	The wild bootstrap method can provide empirical distributions for

	a tight relationship between mental rotation proficiency and white

  abstract = {A method for the spatial normalization and reorientation of diffusion
	tensor (DT) fields is presented. Spatial normalization of tensor
	fields requires an appropriate reorientation of the tensor on each
	voxel, in addition to its relocation into the standardized space.
	This appropriate tensor reorientation is determined from the spatial
	normalization transformation and from an estimate of the underlying
	fiber direction. The latter is obtained by treating the principal
	eigenvectors of the tensor field around each voxel as random samples
	drawn from the probability distribution that represents the direction
	of the underlying fiber. This approach was applied to DT images from
	nine normal volunteers, and the results show a significant improvement
	in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after spatial normalization and averaging
	of tensor fields across individuals. The statistics of the spatially
	normalized tensor field, which represents the tensor characteristics
	of normal individuals, may be useful for quantitatively characterizing
	individual variations of white matter structures revealed by DT imaging
	(DTI) and deviations caused by pathology. Simulated experiments using
	this methodology are also described.},
